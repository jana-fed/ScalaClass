  //TODO application structure

  //setup() database etc
  //mainApplication() we loop until the person quits
  //in the mainApplication we ask for tasks to be entered
  //you should register tasks with timestamp (you saw how it is in SQLite with created column)
  //should have an option to show remaining tasks and also to delete tasks
  //delete tasks should be done by setting a column (named done) to 1 for the row for that particular tasks
  //probably should have a column finished which you would use to store timestamp for finishing

  //if things go really well you could think about supporting tasks for multiple users then you need a users table and reference to that user in tasks table

  //cleanup()

  //then you could add some functions to display longest running tasks etc
