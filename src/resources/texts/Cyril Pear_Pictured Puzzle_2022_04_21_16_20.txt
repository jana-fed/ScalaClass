Thus tofind how many selections of 3 at a time can be made out of 8 we look forthe third number on the horizontal row that commences with 8, and findthe answer 56.The series is formed thus: Set down the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., as far asyou please, in a vertical row. To the right of 2 place 1, add themtogether, and set 3 under the 1. Then add 3 to 3, and set the resultbelow, and so on, always placing the sum of two numbers that are side byside below the one on the right.No. LXV.--MULTIPLICATION NO VEXATIONThis diagram shows an ancient and curious method of multiplication,which will be novel to most of our readers.              ^             ╱│╲           2╱ │ ╲5           ╱  │  ╲          ╱ 1 │ 0 ╲         ╱│╲  │  ╱│╲       4╱ │ ╲ │ ╱ │ ╲3       ╱  │  ╲│╱  │  ╲      ╱ 2 │ 0 ╳ 0 │ 6 ╲     ╱│╲  │  ╱│╲  │  ╱│╲   3╱ │ ╲ │ ╱ │ ╲ │ ╱ │ ╲4   ╱  │  ╲│╱  │  ╲│╱  │  ╲  │ 1 │ 5 ╳ 1 │ 2 ╳ 0 │ 8 │   ╲  │  ╱│╲  │  ╱│╲  │  ╱    ╲ │ ╱ │ ╲ │ ╱ │ ╲ │ ╱     ╲│╱  │  ╲│╱  │  ╲│╱      ╲ 0 │ 9 ╳ 1 │ 6 ╱       ╲  │  ╱│╲  │  ╱        ╲ │ ╱ │ ╲ │ ╱         ╲│╱  │  ╲│╱          ╲ 1 │ 2 ╱           ╲  │  ╱            ╲ │ ╱             ╲│╱              v  ─────────────────────────   1    8   2   6   2    8  ─────────────────────────In this instance 534 is multiplied by 342.

COUNTING THE GEESE(_From an old Sanscrit source, quoted by Longfellow in his “Kavanagh.”_)Ten times the square root of a flock of geese, seeing the cloudscollect, flew to the Manus lake. One-eighth of the whole flew from theedge of the water among a tangle of water lilies, and three couples wereseen playing in the water. Tell me, my young girl with beautiful locks,what was the whole number of geese?55.

PRESS PARODIESAn American paper published the following:--  There was a young damsel, oh, bless her!  It cost very little to dress her;          She was sweet as a rose          In her everyday clothes,  But had no young man to caress her.Next day this parody appeared in a rival paper:--  There was a young ......, oh, bless her!  It cost very little to dress her;          Some ........... and .....          About Thanksgiving time,  And they ... the last bit from the ....... .Can you fill in the missing words?No. LXXII.--HEXAGONAL ILLUSIONSIf we look with one eye only, or with eyes half-closed, at these groupsof circular dots, they assume the appearance familiar to us inhoneycomb. This is an effect of the contrast and opposition of the blackand white in the sensation of the retina.[Illustration]Although the black and the white circles are of the same diameter theirradiation is in their case so intense that the white circles appear tobe larger than the black.No. LXXIII.--AN ILLUSION OF ARCHESThis excellent illusion appeared in a recent number of the “StrandMagazine”:--[Illustration]Most persons will at first see the passages under these arches asrunning upwards from left to right, but presently, as their line ofvision shifts, the arches will take a downward course from right toleft. This very curious effect will well repay a little patience, if itis not realised at once.57. WHERE WAS THE WEDDING?  She loses her head when she joins the brides,    He joins them after tea;  But both are swept by ruthless tides    Away on the western sea.58. ON A BANANA BARROWI have 91 bananas on my barrow, of two qualities; some I sell at four apenny, and the better sort at three a penny. If I had sold them in mixedlots at seven for twopence, I should have made a penny more. How manywere there of each quality?No. LXXIV.--IN THE TRAINThe Puzzle Problem--  A passenger in a first-class railway carriage notices that the top of  a factory window due S.W. of him coincides with a mark on the carriage  window, and does not move from it while the train is running five and  a half miles.  [Illustration]  At the end of that distance the compass bearing of the chimney is due  N.W. How far was the passenger from the chimney when he first noticed  it?is solved by 3¹⁄₂ miles.We give a diagram to make the points clear.As the chimney top does not move from its place on the window, it isclear that the train is running on a segment of a circle having thechimney for its centre. It follows that the observer’s distancethroughout is equal to the radius of that circle, and the radius of acircle of which the quadrant measures 5¹⁄₂ miles is 3¹⁄₂ miles withinabout 11 ft.No. LXXV.--MENDING THE FLAGThe cross had been taken out from the centre of this flag, and itsowner, who had an ingenious turn of mind, found that by cutting whatremained into two pieces, and rejoining them, he could make it into aperfect flag without any waste of material.[Illustration]How did he accomplish this?No. LXXVI.--FOR THE CHILDRENAdd two more pieces similar in shape and size to that marked A, and onesimilar to B, C, and D respectively, and then readjust the eleven partsso that they form a perfect square.[Illustration]59. MISSING WORDS  How does the sluggard’s garden grow?  When ..... are high results are low.  His borders ..... and bindweed spoil,  No careful culture ..... the soil;  But weeds that ..... are all alive  Where ..... pink or rose should thrive.The missing words are spelt with the same letters.No. LXXVII.--AN EASY MATCH PUZZLEThis is a simple arrangement of eight matches, by which two squares andfour similar triangles are formed.[Illustration]60.

BURIED TOWNS  Wait while I think the matter over,    On holiday intent;  The best I’ve seen is surely Dover,    That pretty port of Kent.Three towns are buried in these lines.No. LXXVIII.--WALKING THE ROUNDSA hospital was built in six detached blocks, and it was the duty of thenight watchman to go completely round every block at fixed hours to seethat all was safe.[Illustration]What was his shortest course?62. THE ARAB AND HIS ASS  An Arab came to the river side    With a donkey bearing an obelisk,  But he did not venture to ford the tide,    For he had too good an *.  So he camped all night by that river side,    Secure till the tide had ceased to swell,  For he knew that whenever the donkey died    No other could be its ‖.No. LXXIXCan you rearrange the twelve counters on this board of 36 squares sothat there are two counters on each row, column, and diagonal?  ╔═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╗  ║   │   │   │   │   │   ║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║   │   │   │   │   │   ║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ ║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ │ ◎ ║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║   │   │   │   │   │   ║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║   │   │   │   │   │   ║  ╚═══╧═══╧═══╧═══╧═══╧═══╝There must not be more than these two counters in the same straightline.63.

AFTER THE MATCH“Did you score a score?” said Funniman to his schoolboy nephew, after alocal cricket match. “No, uncle,” said the youngster, “but if I had madeas many more runs, half as many more, and two runs and a half, I shouldhave made my twenty.” How many runs did he get?No. LXXXI.--A NEST OF TRIANGLESIn the “Twentieth Century Standard Puzzle Book” we gave a figure similarto this, in which there were 653 interlacing triangles in four tiers ofthis character.[Illustration]We now add a fifth tier at the base, and ask our solvers to determinehow many triangles of all shapes and sizes can be counted within itsenlarged borders.65.

A CHARADE  My first is the French for my second,  My whole a narcotic is reckoned.No. C.--A GOOD PATTERNHere is a very symmetrical Knight’s tour, in which half of the moves areindicated by dotted, and half by unbroken lines:--[Illustration]82. PALINDROME WORDSThe letters of this sentence “Arrive to vote at it,” can be so recast asto form two palindrome words, or words that read alike from either end.What are they?No. CI.--A KNIGHT’S TOURHere is another specimen of the Knight’s tour, which is beautifullysymmetrical--[Illustration]Half of the course is marked with dotted lines.83. AN ENIGMA  Sweet till I lose my head,    Sweet-hearted then I show;  Decapitate again, I spread,    And cannot be below.  Served so once more, I am not dead,    But with fresh beauty glow.No. CII.--A KNIGHT’S POETIC TOUROn the board below a verse of eight lines runs on the course of aKnight’s move from square to square:--  ╔══════╤══════╤══════╤══════╤══════╤══════╤══════╤══════╗  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║  sor │  to  │ king │ good │  say │ luck │  loy │  eth ║  ╟──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────╢  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║  and │ moth │   a  │ soon │  dis │  our │  to  │  bad ║  ╟──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────╢  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║ place│  ry  │church│  his │ force│  is  │  hat │  al  ║  ╟──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────╢  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║  er  │ queen│  him │ wight│  he  │  to  │  may │ truth║  ╟──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────╢  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║  man │  his │  and │  and │ chess│  es  │knight│ op’s ║  ╟──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────╢  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║   a  │ sneer│  the │  and │  un  │ lawn │  of  │ tates║  ╟──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────╢  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║  cas │ that │  at  │ less │ pawn │  no  │ bish │ lant ║  ╟──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────╢  ║      │      │      │      │      │      │      │      ║  ║  eth │ faith│ tles │ hath │  the │  gal │  in  │ love ║  ╚══════╧══════╧══════╧══════╧══════╧══════╧══════╧══════╝Can you disentangle the little poem?84.

IF WE COULD CHOOSE“If it were possible, I should choose,” said young Hopeful, “a lifedouble as long.”“Yes,” said old Sobersides, “and you might turn it to better account ifit was also begun old.”How did their actual words bear this out?No. CV.--SEEING THROUGH A VEILOn a piece of clear tracing paper draw with pen and ink a close networkof lines, such as is shown in this diagram, near enough together toconceal type of ordinary size.[Illustration]Place this on the page of a book, and challenge any one to read asentence, or even a word, through it, saying that you can do so easily.How can you succeed?87. A CHARADE  Lop head and tail, and you will find    I have both tail and head.  Or if for spirits you’ve a mind    Set my tail first instead.  Life, as “a vapour full of woes,”    With many a darker page,  My whole in picture will disclose,    For “all the world’s a stage!”No. CVI.--THE PAPER RINGSIn the diagram a strip of paper is shown (1), with its ends simplygummed together; (2), with a single twist; and (3), with a double twist.Can you decide, without actual experiment, what will be the result ineach case if these are cut completely round, as is indicated by thedotted lines?[Illustration]88. MISSING WORDS  A glowing ........ window, graced  With ........ that true art has traced.89. ANSWER BY ANAGRAMHow do the actual letters of these words in their union prove thatanæsthetics are “blessed in pain?”No. CVII.--THE MAGIC BUTTONSMake two parallel cuts with a penknife along the centre of a slip ofleather or other material, and below them a hole of the same width. Passa piece of string under the slit, and through the hole, and tie twobuttons, each much larger than the hole, to the ends of the string.[Illustration]How can the string be released without removing either of the buttons?No. CVIII.--THE CAPTIVE SCISSORSFasten a pair of scissors securely with a piece of string to someconvenient article, as is shown in this diagram:--[Illustration]Can you release them without cutting or unfastening the string?90. A BURIED QUOTATION“What sin was it, sonny?” said an American negress to her lover, whenshe sat on his best hat, which was flattened. Wearily he heard hermusical laugh, and arose to go. His hobby was botany, but not hers, forshe was then a merry girl. “Bother the flowers! I would prefer thismellow pine-apple, Leonidas,” she said; “I guess we Ethiopians just lovefruit!”No. CIX.--A PRIMITIVE TRAPThis diagram represents in the simplest outline a primitive wolf-trap.[Illustration]The dotted line is a gate opening into a circular enclosure. How was thetrap set and the wolf caught?91. LADIES AT A SALE  They .... the dress with grip so keen    That half the .... gives way;  And home return with purses lean    To .... of “bargain-day!”What are the missing words?No. CX.--A SPINNING NEEDLETo balance a needle on the head of a pin, push the pin into the cork ofa wine bottle, and the needle into a separate cork.[Illustration]With the aid of three forks, as is shown in the picture, the needle maybe balanced and spun round on the head of the pin.92. MISSING WORDSAir--“_Three fishers went sailing_.”  Three ...... went sailing out into the west,    Out into the west as the sun sank low;  Each thought as they ...... of the lad she loved best,    For they all had ......, and each had a beau.    But seas will rise, and spirits will sink,    And they all were too ill of ...... to think,  So these ...... ...... back moaning.Each missing word has the same six letters.No. CXI.--AFTER DINNERThis diagram shows how, as an after-dinner trick, four similarwineglasses can be placed on the table[Illustration]so that the centres of the lowest parts of their stems are equidistantfrom each other.93. A CHARADE  Lurking in riddles oft my first is found;  My second should in ample stores abound,  Or help to make the sweetest songster heard.  Peculiar, and quite proper, is my third.  My whole has found with England’s monarch grace,  The verdant home of many a goodly race.No. CXII.--SECOND SIGHTAsk any one, with this diagram to work upon, to think of any numberbetween 5 and 15, and, while your back is turned, to count up to it,beginning at the lowest step, and saying one, two, three, four, and soon, as each step of cards or single card is reached in the directionindicated by the arrow. When the number thought of has been thus arrivedat, tell him to stop, and beginning afresh on that card, to count one,two, three, etc., _backwards_, this time _skipping over the double six_and the 3 steps until he again reaches the number thought of, andnotices which card he has touched last.[Illustration]How can you, without having seen any of his movements, at once find thatcard?No. CXIII.--AN AFTER DINNER TRICKCut a wedge out of an apple, as is indicated in the diagram, and makesix gashes as is shown.[Illustration]When this has been done, challenge anyone to divide the apple into sixpieces by only two straight cuts, so that there shall be one of thegashes in each piece.94. ALIKE TO THE EYE  Accent my head,    An opening I appear  In other fashions said    I charm all far and near.No. CXIV.--A TOY BOOMERANGCut out in cardboard a boomerang as nearly as possible of the size andpattern given here:--[Illustration: BOOMERANG]Place it flat on the back of the first three fingers of the left hand,sloping them upward; then flick it smartly with the second finger of theright hand. It will fly off and return to your lap. Try it.95. LONDON BY ANAGRAMHere are two simple sentences:--  A lamp shines out for thee.  Win me best by tears.Can you recast the letters, so that they form the names of two of themost important buildings in London?96. HEARD ON THE BRIGHTON BEACHIt was low tide; two children were throwing pebbles into the sea, andsending their excited collie in pursuit of them. The Puzzle Editor, whowas on holiday, quickened perhaps by the salt air, bethought him of thisappropriate riddle:--What is the difference between that dog and ahungry man?No. CXV.--IN THE GRIP OF A RADISHCut a radish in half, press the lower surface firmly against a plate, asis shown in the diagram:--[Illustration]and you can lift the plate, to which it clings as closely as a boy’s wetleather disc to the pavement.97. FIND THE ANIMAL  A part of me in rain,  A part in hail must be,  A part belongs to pain,  A part in bones we see,  A part in gleaming gold,  A part in common copper.  A part in peace behold,  A part in any topper;  Two parts are heard in sound,  And in our finals found.No. CXVI.--ELASTIC PAPERThe countryman who cut one hole in his door for the cat and another forthe kitten would find it difficult to pass a penny through a hole thesize of a shilling cut in a stout piece of paper.This diagram shows how easily it can be done:--[Illustration]Fold the paper across the centre of the hole, place the penny in thefold, and bend the lower corners of the paper upwards. This elongatesthe opening, and the coin falls through.98. A SMART ENIGMA  Men commonly say I am clever,    Book-learning I never could boast;  Yet I turn the leaves inside the cover,    And when I am found I am lost.99. MISSING WORDS  .... is like a ..... or what is most  Comparative, a ..... is like a . ...;  For when their substances in liquor sink  Both properly are said to be in drink.One of the letters of the two short words is used twice in the longerword.No. CXVII.--THE NIMBLE SIXPENCEPlace a sixpence on the tablecloth, and over it set a tumbler, as isshown in the picture below.[Illustration]How can you pocket the sixpence without removing the glass, or having itremoved?100. A PIED PROVERB  ~abdeefiinnnoopprrrsssttuw~101. SELF-DEFINED  A wordy warfare waged with wit,    In youth its joys none need descry;  But where our elders take to it    Its name points loss of dignity.No. CXVIII.--HOW TO DRAW A SPIRALHow can you draw such a spiral as this with very simple appliances?[Illustration]This spiral is drawn rapidly without removing the pencil from the paper.102. FIND THE HERO  My first’s in garb, but not in dress;  My next’s in praise, but not in bliss;  My third’s in man, but not in miss;                    My fourth’s in we.  My fifth’s in boar, but not in hog;  My sixth’s in cat, but not in dog;  My next’s in calm, but not in fog;                    My eighth’s in we.  My ninth’s in rope, but not in twine;  My tenth’s in light, but not in shine;  My next’s in four, but not in nine;                    My twelfth’s in we.No. CXIX.--FOR HANDY FINGERSTake a piece of stout paper or thin cardboard, about 10 in. by 8 in.,and cut it as is shown below, removing the parts that are shaded in thediagram.[Illustration]If you hold this between a plain wall, or other surface, and a stronglight, you will, with a little practice, be able to cast a shadowsimilar to one or other of these Madonna heads, which will vary inintensity and expression with the positions of the paper and the light.No. CXX.--THE FOUR KINGSThis excellent and easy little card trick will commend itself forfireside use in the long evenings.Take the four Kings from a pack, and two other cards. Hold the Kingsthus, in the form of a fan--[Illustration]hiding the two other cards behind the King of Diamonds.After showing them, place the six cards at the bottom of the pack. Nowmove the lowest card to the top, and the two next cards to any part ofthe pack, apparently leaving but one King at the bottom. Ask some one tocut the pack, and all the Kings will be found together. Some appropriatepatter will help the effect.103. PROVERB BY ANAGRAMCan you recast this sentence--  A defeat whose test is very sure--so that the same letters form an appropriate proverb?No. CXXI.--DOMINO SQUAREIts cells add up in columns and rows to 22, and those of the cornersquares add up to 10 and 12 respectively.  ┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐  │ 6 │ 2   2 │ 0   6 │ 5   1 │  ├   ┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤  │ 1 │ 5 │ 4 │   │ 3 │ 3 │ 6 │  ├───┼   ┼   ┤   ├   ┼   ┼   ┤  │ 3 │ 3 │ 4 │   │ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │  ├   ┼───┴───┘   └───┴───┼───┤  │ 0 │                   │ 0 │  ├───┼───┬───┐   ┌───┬───┼   ┤  │ 2   4 │ 6 │   │ 5   4 │ 1 │  ├───┼───┼   ┤   ├───┼───┼───┤  │ 4 │ 2 │ 6 │   │ 2   5 │ 3 │  ├   ┼   ┼───┼───┼───┼───┼   ┤  │ 6 │ 6 │ 0   0 │ 3   1 │ 6 │  └───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘104. PHONETIC MISSING WORDS  ’Tis ..... that no one takes a .....    To .... a .... of ....s;  A .... may often take a ....    To .... away the ....s.No. CXXII.--THE TALKING HEADThis, though quite an old illusion, may be a mystery to some of ourreaders, so we give it a place among our many curiosities.[Illustration]The table is placed on the middle of a platform, well away from thebackground, and the head, which is very much alive, is prepared toanswer questions, or to whistle, or to sing, at the will of theaudience. “How it is done” will be explained.105. A QUEER OBSTACLE  I’m in everyone’s way,    Yet no one I stop.  My four horns each day    Horizontally play,  And my head is nailed on at the top.No. CXXIII.--A GENERAL OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE[Illustration]With a little ingenuity, and by slightly warming the wax, and shreddingthe matches for some effects, all sorts of comical figures can becontrived, similar in character to this dignified general on hishigh-stepping charger.106. AN OLD ENIGMA(By a former Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin.)  Take five from five, and then    Put fifty in the middle;  Twice ten times five times ten    Will finish off my riddle,  And bring it to your ken    As fit as any fiddle!No. CXXIV.--ANOTHER BOOMERANGCut out in cardboard a cross similar to that shown in this diagram:--[Illustration]Place one of its limbs under the thumbnail of the left hand, and givethe next projecting limb a sharp flick with the middle finger of theright hand. The little boomerang will fly sharply forward, andinvariably return rapidly on its tracks. Try it.107. PHONETIC GAPSCan you fill these gaps with words of similar sound?  No ..... will ..... before the wind    A ..... will ... before it;  We cannot .... the ...., or find    That earthly powers ..... o’er it.The gaps in line 1 take words that sound alike; so do those in line 2;and so do the other three in lines 3 and 4.No. CXXV.--A PICTURE CHARADECan you fill in the missing words so as to complete this picturecharade?[Illustration]  My first may .... candle ...,    My second then ..... ..;  My whole in ..... moves .....    ....... an oar or ...108. SOUND SENSE  We seem to sound a note of lavish bounty;  Reverse us, and we indicate a county.109. A CRYPTOGRAM  ~FTHNMLKBRNGSLLCTTN~  ~LLSKMTMXTTLLTSTHN!~Can you so deal with this as to form a rhyming couplet?No. CXXVI.--WALNUTS AND COBS_A good after dinner trick_Place four walnuts and four cobnuts in a row, as indicated on thediagram.[Illustration]Now, moving always two that stand together, transfer them to some otherpositions along the line, and in four such moves leave them so that thelarge and small nuts range alternately. It may, of course, be done withlarge and small coins, or with other things that are at hand.110. A BURIED PROVERB  Yet I see them all! on golden wings that fly    Old memories steal anew;  With a tear, with a sigh, with an old, old cry    They return in ghostly hue!111. DOUBLETSHere is another exercise in Doublets, from Lewis Carroll’s book on thesubject:--Turn ELM into OAK by seven links, introducing the name of another treeas one of them.No. CXXVII.--A PICTURE RIDDLECan you read in this picture the question of our riddle?[Illustration]112. TWO POSERS1.  My dear Mr Bird,    We are giving a ball;  First second we third,    Pray give us your all.2.  Second, I did my first and last,    Till I became my whole;  And told the tale of my repast,    A sad and greedy soul.No. CXXVIII.--BUY A BROOMHere is an excellent example of how a characteristic figure may becontrived by shredding, warming, and uniting a few wax matches:--[Illustration]Many similar figures can be made by handy fingers.113. A CHARADE  My whole, industrious, wends his way    His daily task to meet;  Behead, transpose, and lo! a sound    Of music soft and sweet;  Behead again, I make my way    With swiftness past belief;  Again, and where the fields are gay    My bounty brings relief.No. CXXIX.--JEU DE PARQUET(_For the children_)An old book, published more than 100 years ago, gives the followingsamples of patterns which may be formed with very simple materials:--[Illustration]All that is needed for this pastime is a set of 128 coloured triangles,64 of each colour, with which an endless variety of patterns can bearranged by the exercise of taste and ingenuity.114. LINES BY AN OLD OXBRIDGE DON  ’Tis an absurdity to say  Women should try for a B.A.  To College honours forward looking;  They’d best confine themselves to cooking!How could a Girton girl retort, using the same words?115. LESS AND MORE  Eight letters (start with b)    Three syllables contain;  Take one away, and see    Four syllables remain!116. BURIED BEASTSCan you dig out nineteen beasts that are buried in these lines?--Ireland’s lot heals slowly. Troubles came long ago--at times inbattalions--to attack and harass her. Ambitious democrats nowcountermine famous enthusiasts nearly akin to heroes. Anarchy enablescowards to sow hot terror and all amazement.117. PALINDROMIC VERSECan you recast the following sentences so that their words form a verseof four lines, which makes good sense, with lines that rhymealternately, when read from either end?:--Fading slowly day dies, mournful winds sigh, Stars are waking brightly;owlet holding high revel flies hooting, breaking nightly silence.118. AN ANAGRAM IN THE MAKING“The Observatory at Greenwich, in England,” has been turned into anexcellent anagram, which starts--_On landing here begin_--Can youcomplete it?119. AN ENIGMA  No man at all am I    And, if you turn me round,  To hear my warning cry    Not any men are found.120. ASK A SAILOR  How can our sailors fare the best    When times are harder?  How do they greet with merry jest    An empty larder?121. AN ENIGMA  I lose my head when I am here,  Transpose me I am three;  Look in a book, you find me there,  And with me her and he.122. MISSING WORDS  Jack did ....... that he could square    The circle to a .......;  His friends ....... that a brain so rare    Required attention ........The missing words are spelt with the same seven letters.123. A HUMAN PRODIGY  My father is my son,    And I’m my mother’s mother;  My daughter and sister are one,    I’m grandam to my brother!How was this?124. A CHARADE  Catch my first with nimble wit,    Add a simple word;  Then my whole may help a bit    Opportunely heard.125. A PARADOX  My mate and I from home did start,  Some little space we were apart.  When we had run a mile or more  We kept our distance, as before;  Shade of Colenso! could this be,  When twice as fast as I ran he?126. AN ENIGMA(_From Lewis Carroll’s Papers_.)  A monument all men agree  Am I in all sincerity,      Half cat, half hindrance made.  If head and tail removed should be,  Then most of all you strengthen me.  Replace my head, the stand you see      On which my tail is laid.127. A CHARADE  I’m known to the poorest and worst,    And my worth by a child may be reckoned;  The least thing in nature is double my first,    And my whole is just half of my second.128. WHAT IS IT?  My first without its head and tail    Is one and undivided;  My second shows its teeth, is frail,    And as a rule one-sided.  The two to hold my first avail,    My busy toil provided.129. BURIED TOWNSIn each of these sentences a town is buried:--  His sister played the piano while we sang.  I saw Nell out here last evening.  The general rode a large black mare.  I have ordered a cab at half-past one.  Meet me in the lane at half-past nine.Can you dig them out?130. A GOOD ANAGRAM“The leaning tower of Pisa, in Tuscany, Italy.” The first seven words ofits anagram are “A funny spot in a sweet city.” Can you complete theanagram by adding four more appropriate words?131. MISSING WORDS          When they found that catacomb          Near the ....... at Rome  ’Twas the ....... discussion of the season;          But the ....... effect          Of the skeletons select  Deprived the poor Professor of his reason!132. A CHARADE  My first is pretence,    My second a dandy;  When fogs are most dense    My whole will be handy.133. A DECISIVE ANAGRAMCan you prove by anagram that, whatever may be true of other playsaccredited to Shakespeare, Bacon had certainly no hand in “Much AdoAbout Nothinge,” if we adopt the old spelling of the final word?134.

A CHARADEBy Praed  My _first_ was creeping on his way  Through the mists of a dull October day,  When a minstrel came to its muddy bed,  With a harp on his shoulder, a wreath on his head;  “And how shall I reach,” the poor boy cried,  “To the courts and the cloisters on t’other side?”  Old Euclid came, and he frown’d a frown,  And he dash’d the harp and the garland down;  Then he led the bard, with a stately march,  O’er my _second’s_ long and cellar’d arch;--  “And see,” said the sage, “how every ass  Over the sacred stream must pass!”  The youth was mournful, the youth was mute,  He sigh’d for his laurel, he sobb’d for his lute;--  The youth took comfort, the youth took snuff,  And follow’d the lead of that teacher gruff;  And he sits, ever since, in my _whole’s_ kind lap,  In a silken gown and a trencher cap.305  Upright and honest is my _first_;    My _second_ you may see  Upon the frozen lake or stream;    My _whole_ is equity.306  Never wearied, see us stand,  A glittering and a stately band--  Of sturdy stuff, but graceful form,  In summer cold, in winter warm;  From hottest duty never swerving,  Night and day our place preserving;  Each serving to a different use,  Not to be changed without abuse.  And, pray, mark well another fact--  In unison we never act,  Except, as on occasion dread,  We watch the ashes of the dead;  When we are ranged, as you may see  As awful sentries, one, two, three.307. A CHARADE  My first, though naught, with others is a fruit,  My next is vital to both man and brute.  It should be dear to all who hate the devil,  For it is ever the reverse of evil.  My all, when whole, is eloquent of peace,  Divided it invokes to life that will not cease.308. A CHARADE_In English Sapphics_  Guess at my first, ’tis easy to discover,  Covered with rings, and whiskered like a dandy.  Wrapped up in furs, ’tis often on the housetop,          Oft in the chimney!  See where my second, scorning to be hidden,  Stands at the head of quite a band of others,  Like a virago, straddling with feet apart,          And arms akimbo.  Surely my next is happy in its office,  Parting the lovelocks on Neæra’s forehead;  Setting the golden lines wherewith she angles          For the unwary.  If by my whole at any time you pass, you  Tread on the dust of holy saints and martyrs,  Holy the place, may holy thoughts attend you,          Peacefully dreaming!309  Offspring of nature and of art, I stand  Chief ’midst the monuments of every land;  I may not lengthen life, but I  For centuries forbid to die.  The greatest truth in me you meet  Is but deception most complete.  Unchanged I last the changing crowds among,  And as I older grow, I grow too young.310  Pronounced as one letter, and written with three,  Two letters there are, and two only in me;  I’m double, I’m single, I’m black, blue, and gray,  I’m read from both ends, and the same either way.311  My _first_ is false as false can be;    My _next_ old ladies wear;  My _whole’s_ my _first_, as you will see,    As false, I do declare.312. SHUFFLED LETTERS  When whole I am indeed a thing    To puzzle you a bit;  Though parts of me are hard, at Bridge    The others make a hit;  Or you may make a car of some,    And fix a head to it.313. FIVE VOWELS  A word of nine letters explains  How to mitigate bodily pains;      The five vowels are there,      And four consonants share  This function for medical brains.314. A CHARADE  My second guides my first and third    For pleasure, trade, and war;  My first and second by my third    Are oft transported far.  But when my first my third doth pull,    ’Tis then his lot is worst;  And should my second lack my whole,    He’s apt to leave my first.315.

THE BONES OF A PALINDROME  ~DRWNDRRDNWRD~.Insert the missing letters, and so form a perfect palindrome, whichreads alike from either end.317  The schoolboy likes me well,  For healthful sport I bring,  Yet I can harm create,  Though such a little thing:  Connubial bliss is form’d by me;  My nature is equality.318. A RIDDLEWhat person’s name is doubly evil?The answer may be given in a line that rhymes.319    I’m a district near London;    If made wrong, I come undone;    O’er sweet strings I swift run,    Or appear with the bright sun,  And though by me fights were won,    I can greet you every one.320. A CHARADE  I am my first when seen with you,    My next is always bad.  A rogue in grain much harm may do    And make the farmer mad.321. A CHARADE  When winter comes with frost and cold,  My first is welcome, as of old;  And though its grip may make you thinner,  It helps to cook your Christmas dinner.  Let me but hear my next rejoice  At early dawn with cheerful voice,  I haste to find, with eager pleasure,  Some specimen of hidden treasure.  A traveller my whole may find  Far from his English kith and kind;  Though some at home, to England’s shame,  Are this in fact, if not in name.322.  It was to-morrow, and    It will be yesterday;  Now it is near at hand    What is it? Who can say?323. A CHARADE  My first doth fill with light his father’s eyes,    The second shadows all the mother’s brow;  My whole all men, all women, girls and boys,    Have had, and long to lose, and lost for ever now;    But know not, nor can know, when it was lost, and how.324. ON THE BLOCK  Complete, though not of human race,    A soul in me may dwell;  Behead, I held a higher place,    Until, like man, I fell.  Again behead, and in the song    Of Burns I’m all your own;  Behead once more, it would be wrong    To find me out when known.325. AN ENIGMA  With head good for naught,    And with tail always drunk,  You know well what to say    Of the worth of my trunk.  First cut off my tail,    I am Greek, and I’m not;  Then cut off my head,    And some Latin you’ve got.  Lopping both you know best    What remains, as I said,  For I really am you    If I lose tail and head!326. AN ENIGMA  One guiding eye I need    In running through the gaps;  My tail, as on I speed,    Is caught in many traps.327. A CHESS CHARADEBy H. J. C. AndrewsIn the ’seventies no one was more popular at Simpson’s Chess Room in theStrand than the gentle and brilliant subject of these lines, a cleverwater-colourist. The charade is by his friend, the well-known problemcomposer. Both have passed away, but they are not forgotten by those whohad the happiness to know them:--  Of all the birds that ever sought a mate,  My first is to but one appropriate,  So speak the word! nor silence shyly woo.  To find my next, go! wander in the Zoo!  My whole is a magician of the squares,  But Art, with Chess, his best affections shares,  So this, indeed, to him may be a law  When _winning_’s hopeless, grandly still to _draw_.328. WHAT AM I?  Though poor and humble was my birth    I sit enthroned on high;  My footsteps far above the earth,    My canopy the sky.  O’er toiling subjects thus in state    I bear despotic sway;  Yet on them hand and foot I wait    At break and close of day.329.  I am not of flesh and blood,    Yet have I many a bone;  No limbs, except one leg,    And can’t stand on that alone.  My friends are many, and dwell    In all lands of the human race;  But they poke my poor nose into the mud,    And shamefully spatter my face.  Thrust me into each other’s ribs,    Stick me in gutter and rut;  I have never a window, and never a door,    Yet I often open and shut.330. AN ENIGMA  Before the crown descended on    The head of England’s Queen,  Four Kings upon that royal throne    Of the same name had been.  Now if the signs which marked their name    Be joined unto a beast,  We have a food on which the same    (A quadruped) will feast.331. AN OLD ENIGMABy _Charles James Fox_  I am pretty, and useful in various ways,  Though I tempt some poor mortals to shorten their days;  Behead me, and then in my place will appear  What youngsters admire every day in the year;  Behead me once more, and without any doubt,  You must be what is left if you don’t find it out.332. A CHARADE  My first, when skilfully performed  (Its doer by applauses warmed),    Bespeaks both skill and vigour.  When with my whole, so soft and light,  I saw my second gay bedight,    She made a splendid figure.333. MISSING WORDS  The man who ..... the common .....    Above the ..... chaste,  ..... as he may, the world declares    Is not a man of taste.  And though my sympathy he shares,    No ..... on him I waste!334. A CHARADE  When a monk in old times, unexpectedly heated,    Endangered the peace of his soul,  To atone for my second my first he repeated    Quite ten times a day on my whole.335. AN ENIGMA  An insect small and fell    Makes a weird sound,  If, as its name you spell,    You turn it round.  One letter cast, and still    Shift what remains,  Another insect will    Reward your pains.336. A DECAPITATION  Where head and body duly meet    I am as slender as a bee;  Whether I stand on head or feet    My figure shows its symmetry.  But when my head is cut away    The metamorphosis is strange;  Though both of them unaltered stay,    Body and head to nothing change.337. A NUT TO CRACK  First is in coast, second in ghost,  Third must be reckoned part of second;  Fourth in boat, fifth in float,  Sixth you will find within your mind.  Seventh in blue, eighth in true,  These letters tell a fruit that they spell.338.  The hunter and his steed are known        My first to see.  Though men may call my next a stone,        Wood it may be.  My whole, an exile from his home,  Is doomed from place to place to roam.339. A CHARADE  My first expresses power to do,    My next that it is done.  To be my whole belongs to few,    And perfectly to none.340. A CHARADE  In my first, as in a shell,  All the sweetest sounds may dwell;  In my second, shells abound  That can catch no sort of sound;  In my whole securely rest  Those who neither jeer nor jest.341. A CHARADE  My first, though of the feathered kind    Is never known to fly;  My next all who improve their mind    Seize as it passes by.  My whole may much occasion find    To make the truthful lie.342. AN ENIGMA  Divide a piece of beef or pork  Without the aid of knife and fork;  It gives a shelf, rejoined with skill,  Where you may set this if you will.  Strike off instead the end, its place  Is plain as nose upon your face.  Cut this asunder in your mind,  And what is first put now behind;  Part of our foot you thus discover,  And in a measure all is over.343. A CHARADE  Seen as a whole, my form is now    Akin to strife and malice;  Split, it may grace a princely brow,    Or crown the curls of Alice.  Recast my letters, and I tell    That nourishment is lacking;  Stir them afresh until they spell    The needle’s help in tacking.344. AN ENIGMA  If I write with my first in my second    My whole you can never find out;  Add a letter, and all will be reckoned    A patron of water devout.345. WHAT DID THE COLONEL SAY?After officers’ mess, when cigars were well alight, the old conundrumwas propounded, “What is most like a cornet of horse?” A sharp sub. wasready with the reply, “A hornet, of course”; it was presently capped bythis variant which occurred to a married captain, “a corset of horn”;and yet another reading was suggested by the deaf old colonel, “How muchdid you say the ..............” Can you complete this?346. WHERE WAS IT?  Loss of love between us    Never can be nice;  Yet we live where Venus    Changes us to ice.347. A LOVER TO HIS LASS  Tell me, my sweet,  Why are your feet      Like fairy tales?348. MISSING WORDS  Our parson ....... every man who has leisure    To study ....... windows, the glory of fanes;  And ....... of devoting his income to pleasure,    Our ....... old dean spends his money on panes.349. AN EASY ONE  Though much attached to merriment,    Or crime for a variety,  To prison I am never sent,    But sparkle in society.350. A CHARADE  Without my first and second’s aid  No pudding worth its sauce is made.  Take on my third, my fourth I am,  My fifth includes myself and Sam.  My whole describes the royal fiddler Nero,  And shows him as an unheroic hero.351. BURIED PLACESWhat geographical names are buried in these lines?  He has my R. N. as a monogram  I am her stupid sister.  The calmest man is sometimes made irate.352.  My first’s a fruit of foreign clime,    Sweet to the taste, in price not dear;  My second does my first produce,    And yet my whole my first doth bear.353. AN ENIGMA  A thing of beauty, scattered by a breath,  My firm embrace is harbinger of death;  Not made by hands, a work of wondrous art,  Complete and perfected in every part;  Crush me to-day with all-determined care,  Then look to-morrow, and I shall be there!354. AN ENIGMA  Six letters in my name are found,  Though only three we see and sound;  The shepherd by the running river  May hear me where the rushes quiver;  And should a stroke my whole divide,  Leaving but half on either side,  These, backward read, will surely tell  What many a toper loves too well.355. A RIDDLE  Upon a battle-field of learned men    Hundred and fifty were by none divided.  “Now,” said the bishop, “add two-thirds of ten    And so you’ll guess the riddle just as I did.”356.  Though the stations of mortals are many    And the _last_ is the head of his race;  Yet he, just as often as any,    Is won by my _first’s_ fell embrace;  Yet we most of us apt are to fall,    When our heads cease our hearts to control,  Let us hope that not one of us all    May be e’er in the state of my _whole_.357. WHAT IS IT?  My whole is no matter,    And light as the air,  Yet it is good on the platter,    And excellent fare.  Curtail and transpose,    And a lady you see,  Who will flatter and pose,    And with many do me.358. WHAT IS IT?  My first, for ages out of mind,  All men have always worn behind;  And yet alike by sea and land  They carry it upon their hand.  My second, carefully matured,  Is never ill but often cured.  My whole, within unchanging lines  Black men and white alike confines.359. WHAT IS THIS?  “We westand fall.”360. A CHARADE  My second is pressed tightly round    To guard from any ill;  And when preparing to engage,    Men find it useful still.  My first against attraction set    Will neutralise its power;  Aided by it, with bargains, some    May spend a happy hour.  You find my whole by careful search    Which must not be forsaken;  It stands before what comes beyond,    Which may from it be taken.361. A GOOD ANAGRAMGeorge Thompson, the zealous anti-slavery advocate, was asked to go intoParliament, the better to press his point and cause. When he hesitated afriend produced, as a conclusive reason, this anagram, spelt with theletters of his name--“O go, the negro’s M.P.!”362. WHAT AM I?  Scorned by the meek and humble mind,    And often by the vain possessed,  Heard by the deaf, seen by the blind,    I give the troubled spirit rest.ODDS AND ENDS1.

A DAY’S SPORTAt the invitation of a farmer in the country I went out with my gun fora day’s shooting on his farm. “What sport had you?” said a friendafterwards at the Club. “I shot only birds and rabbits,” was my reply,“and the bag showed 36 heads and 100 feet.” How many birds were there,and how many bunnies?3.

A CROSS PURPOSECan our readers rearrange these letters in the form of a similar cross,so that they form two words familiar to us all?        A        A        E  D N R E G D N        I        T        V        SOne of the letters, to be placed where the lower E now stands, is commonto both words.5.“Take this sovereign, my boy,” said a man to his son who had a turn forarithmetic, “and buy for yourself and for your three sisters the bestpresent possible for each, of different values, expending in each casean aliquot part of the pound, that is to say, a fraction of it whosenumerator is one. If there is any change you can give it to the FreshAir Fund.” How was this commission carried out?6. A WORD SQUARECan you complete this word-square?  . E . A .  E . A . E  . A . . E  A . . E .  . E E . .7. VERBAL ARITHMETICFirst find a word that is spelt with the ten letters above the line, andnumber its letters consecutively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.    A I    L C    P R    U N    B E  _____  E C CSubstitute the corresponding figures for the letters, and then work outthe addition sum which they represent.8.

IS IT POSSIBLE?Fill a wineglass with water to the brim, and set it on the corner of atable-napkin, which should be in immediate contact with the polishedsurface of a table, allowing the rest of the napkin to fall over theedge. Can you remove the napkin without touching the glass or spillingany of the water?13. A NICE CALCULATIONMy third and fourth are a quarter of my first and second; my fourth ishalf of them, and my third is half. What am I?14. FOR THE CHILDRENA London firm, having sent an order by telegram to a manufacturer inParis for 480 sets of Diabolo, received to their amazement a hugeconsignment of 6336 sets. How did this mistake arise?15. A WINTER VALENTINE  Thy heart is like some icy lake    On whose cold brink I stand;  On my sore plight sweet pity take,    And lead me by the hand.  Then buckle on my spirit’s skate    Where all the ice is thin,  That it may break beneath my weight,    And let a lover in!16. A QUESTION OF AGES“My husband’s age,” said Mrs Evergreen, “is represented by the figuresof my age reversed. He is older than I am, and the difference betweenour ages is one-eleventh of their sum.” What were their respective ages?17. MISSING FIGURESCan you complete this multiplication sum?      4 * *        3 *    -------    3 6 * *  * * 7 * *  ---------  * * 3 * *18. STRANGE ADDITION  Add 3 to 10, and then divide  Till 8 the sum has satisfied.19. BEDDING OUTI bought less than 100 plants for my new rosery, and found that if I setthem 3 in a row there would be one over; if 4 in a row there would betwo over; if 5 in a row, three over; and if 6 in a row, four over. Howmany rose trees did I buy?20.Can you arrange three nines so that they represent exactly 20?21.A house has nine windows on its front. How many signals can be given bymerely leaving one or more of them open?22. ON MY BIRTHDAY(By Sir John Evans)  “Reader, whether man or woman,  Write my age in figures Roman.  My first divided by my second  Will make my third, if rightly reckoned;  Ten times the whole, and then you see  My university degree.”23. MOSAIC VERSE  The heath this night must be my bed, (Scott)    Ye vales, ye streams, ye groves, adieu! (Pope)  Farewell for aye; e’en love is dead; (Proctor)    Would I could add remembrance too! (Byron)24. SIGNS AND SEASONS  The springs spring forth in spring, and shoots    Shoot forward one and all;  Though summer kills the flowers, it leaves    The leaves to fall in fall!25. THE TEN DIGITSThis arrangement of the digits represents 20, one being a whole number,the others a fraction:--   13258  6----- = 20    94726. CHRONOGRAMThe battle of Montl’héry was fought in 1465. Its date can be committedto memory in the sentence which might have been a battle-cry--“A cheval,à cheval, gendarmes, à cheval!” For it is arrived at by the addition ofthe Roman numerals which this contains, thus:--  C     =   100  V     =     5  L     =    50  C     =   100  V     =     5  L     =    50  M     =  1000  C     =   100  V     =     5  L     =    50           ----  Total =  146527. A TOUR DE FORCEIn this most remarkable sentence of only twenty-eight letters, everyletter of the alphabet is used--  IF JACK QUIZ BALD NYMPHS GROW VEXT.28. AN OLD TALE OF A TUBTom Hood, seeing over the door of a public-house BEAR SOLD HERE, saidthat it was rightly spelt if it was the landlord’s _own bruin_!29. ALL THE ALPHABETHere is an ingenious rhyming couplet of only 33 letters, in which everyletter of the alphabet is used--  Quick! go on, Jim! why  Stop lazy fox? Drive by!30. AN IMPERIAL ANAGRAM  A sa Majesté impériale le Tsar Nicolas, souverain et autocrate de  toutes les Russies.The same letters exactly spell--  O, ta vanité sera ta perte. O, elle isole la Russie; tes successeurs  te maudiront à jamais!This most remarkable anagram was published in the early days of theCrimean war.31. A FOURFOLD ANAGRAM“Notes and Queries.”  _A question sender.  Enquires on dates.  Reasoned inquest.  I send on a request._32. A GOOD ANAGRAMThe name of John Abernethy, a very brusque doctor of bygone days, lendsitself to this most apposite anagram--_Johnny the bear!_33. TWO EXCELLENT ANAGRAMS(After the Irish famine.)  Duchess of Marlborough.  _She labours much for God._              Or,  The Duchess of Marlborough.  _Lo, she sought much for bread._34. “ENGLISH AS SHE IS SPOKE”French guest to his host after a big shoot:--“How many braces have you to your bags?”35. A PRIZE ANAGRAMIt would be difficult to find a more ingenious and appropriate anagramthan this, which took a prize in “Truth” in 1902, and connects theKing’s recovery with the Coronation.The sentence set was--“God save our newly crowned King and Queen! Long life to Edward andAlexandra!”The letters of this were recast thus--Can we wonder an anxious devoted England followed drear dangerquakingly?36. A PRIZE ANAGRAM“Truth” offered a prize for the best anagram on the sentence--“‘Truth’Toy and Doll Fund, Christmas, nineteen hundred and seven.” The winninganagram, by the Editor of these pages, was, “A sunny tender mindunderstands that the children do love fun!”37. TAKE CARE OF THE PENCEIn a moment of economy I told my wife that I would put by a farthing thefirst week of the New Year, a halfpenny the second week, a penny thethird, and so on, doubling the sum each week to the end of the year. Shehad a turn for figures, and staggered me by showing that I should haveto provide £4,691,249,611,844, 5s. 3³⁄₄d. to carry out my plan!38Now that Ellen Terry has written “The Story of My Life,” this anagramhas a special interest:--  LYCEUM THEATRE, STRAND.  _Teach and melt us, Terry!_38a. RING OUT, WILD BELLS!More startling than the well-known calculation of payment bycontinuously doubling the farthing given for the first nail in a horse’sshoe, is the fact that the possible changes on a peal of 24 bells wouldnot be exhausted if every minute of 4000 years were prolonged to aperiod of 10,000 years!39. A SCHOLAR AT PLAYErasmus himself was responsible in one of his lighter moments for thefollowing ingenious play upon his name:--  Quæritur unde mihi sit nomen Erasmus, _eras mus_;  Si _sum mus_ ego, te judice, _summus_ ero!40. QUITE AN EYESORE!“Well!” cried an agitated carpenter to his mate, “of all the saws that Iever saw saw, I never saw a saw saw as this saw saws!”41. THE PUNSTER’S LAMENT  If I be duly punished  For every foolish pun I shed,  I shall not find one puny shed  In which to hide my punnish head!42. A GOOD ANAGRAM  CONFESSIONS OF AN OPIUM EATER.The same letters recast spell--  _If so, man, refuse poison at once!_43. A TOUR DE FORCEThe following curiosity, constructed some years ago for prize purposesby the Editor, shows how, in word or letter juggling, difficulties canbe overcome:--A sentence in which each letter of the alphabet is used exactly twice:“XLV gruff nymphs jerk XLV jaws,” quoth wag B. Dick, Q.C., to Ben Dizzy,M.P.44. THE MISSING LINKIf anagrams count, our “ancestor” was not a monkey but a _Norse cat_!45. A STRIKING ANAGRAMThe name of Randle Holmes, author of a notable book on heraldry, was sorecast that it formed the words: “Lo, men’s herald!”46. A CURIOUS PALINDROME  Dog as a devil deified lived as a god.47. AFTER THE EVENT_An Anagram._  The Oxford and Cambridge annual Boat-race.  _Cantab blue had raced in an extra good form._48. TO FIND THE GOLDTell a person who holds a sovereign in one hand and a shilling in theother to reckon 4 for the gold, and 3 for the silver. Then bid himtriple what is in the right hand, and double what is in the left, andgive you the added product. If this is an _even_ number the gold is inthe right hand, if _odd_ it is in the left.49. A MUSICAL ANAGRAM  ADELINA PATTI.  _Adept Italian._50. A HAPPY THOUGHTSir Charles Napier’s witty despatch, “Peccavi!” “I have Scinde!” isfamiliar to us. Not so well known is the happy phrase attributed to SirColin Campbell, “Nunc sum fortunatus!” “I am in Lucknow!”51. A CLEVER TRIPLE ANAGRAMOwen, the Welsh epigrammatist, composed this very clever Latin line:--  In _verbis, ubi res_ postulat, esto _brevis_.  (“In words, where the matter requires it, be brief.”)  The words in italics are spelt with the same six letters.52. CAN SUCH THINGS BE?Take a long strip of paper, say 9 in. by 2 in., which will have, ofcourse, an upper and an under surface and two edges along its length.How can you arrange this strip, by quite a simple method so that it willhave only _one_ surface and _one_ edge?53.Can you divide nine into two parts which are together equal to ten?54. FOLDING A FLOCKA shepherd had a flock of sheep in a fold enclosed by 100 hurdles. Hismaster made a large purchase at the annual fair, and required him to pensome pigs with 16 of the hurdles, and to arrange the remainder so thatthey could accommodate nine times as many sheep as the 100 hurdles hadcontained. How was this possible?55. A NEAT TRICKHere is a neat final trick, if you have some reputation for sleight ofhand. Place three biscuits on the table in a row, and cover each of themwith a borrowed hat. Raise each hat in turn, gravely eat the biscuit,and replace the hat. Then undertake that the three biscuits shall beunder whichever hat is selected. How can you contrive this?56. VERY SMALL CHANGEIn how many different ways can 7s. 3d. be paid away in current coin ofthe realm, without ever using exactly the same set of coins a secondtime?SOLUTIONSFRONTISPIECEThe words which describe this picture can be recast, letter for letter,into the perfect anagram--[Illustration: “Please, Mister Elephant, are you there?”]No. IV.It is said that there are 86 ways in which the numbers in this modelmagic square can be added up so that they make 34.  ╔═══╤═══╤═══╤═══╗  ║  4│ 15│ 14│  1║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║  9│  6│  7│ 12║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║  5│ 10│ 11│  8║  ╟───┼───┼───┼───╢  ║ 16│  3│  2│ 13║  ╚═══╧═══╧═══╧═══╝It is not difficult to discover more than half this number that aresymmetrical, including, of course, the 4 rows, 4 columns and 2diagonals.

To setthe trap a lamb was placed in the safe centre, and the gate was openedas is shown below--[Illustration]Attracted by the bleating of the lamb, the wolf entered the outercircle, made his way round, and presently pushed aside the gate, whichclosed with a spring, and shut off all escape.No. CXIIWhen you have told someone to think of a number between 5 and 15, andwhile you are not looking, to count upwards from the lowest card step,and round in the direction indicated by the arrow, until that number isreached, and then, starting afresh with “one” on that card to countbackwards round the semi-circle, this time _not including the centralupright or the steps below it_, until the number thought of is againreached, you can tell at once which is the final card arrived at, for itwill be as many places _upwards on the left_ as there are _step cardsand their upright_.[Illustration]Thus if there are 3 steps, it must always be the fourth card upwards onthe left of the semi-circle. To keep up the puzzle, the number of stepsshould each time be changed, on the pretext that their number does notsignify.No. CXIIIThis diagram shows how the apple may be divided into six pieces by twostraight cuts, so that there shall be a gash in each piece.[Illustration]First cut the apple through the dotted line, then place the upper pieceshown at the side of the larger piece, and make the second cut straightthrough, where the line is drawn.No. CXVIIThe sixpence under the middle of the tumbler can be easily removedthus--[Illustration]Slip larger coins under opposite edges of the tumbler to raise itslightly, and then scratch firmly on the cloth, from just outside therim, in the direction you wish the sixpence to take.

The horses take 15 minutes, and the motors 10 minutes  on the journey.  If I come to Temple Bar, and wish to reach the Bank as soon as  possible, shall I take the first horse ’bus that turns up, or wait for  a motor? It must be assumed that I can only see a ’bus as it actually  passes me--  is (1) Take a motor if it comes first.  (2) Take a horse ’bus if it comes first, and comes within 2¹⁄₂ minutes  of waiting.  (3) Wait for a motor if a horse ’bus comes first, but does not come  till after 2¹⁄₂ minutes.As I may have to wait 0 minutes or 15 minutes, the average time ofwaiting will be 7¹⁄₂ minutes.If I wait _x_ min., and a horse ’bus arrives, I should reach the Bank in15 mins, if I took it.If I waited longer for a motor, which, on the average, will now turn upin 7¹⁄₂ - _x_ mins., I should reach the Bank in 17¹⁄₂ - _x_ mins.If, therefore, _x_ is greater than 2¹⁄₂, the motor is the quicker.12The historical charade--  My first, if foolishly or rashly taken,    May mar the future prospects of your life.  My second, by her fickle lord forsaken    (Sad type of many a gentle, patient wife).  May toil and moil to feed his many babies,    While he goes flirting off with other ladies.  The thrifty monarch of a former age    My whole a place in Britain’s history fills.  Immortalised in Shakespeare’s magic pages    As one who’d fain reform his tailor’s bills!is solved by _Stephen_ (Step-hen).13  My _second_, worn with pompous pride,  My _first_ had dangling at his side,        On chain securely hooked.  My _first_ he came from o’er the sea,  A bundle of conceit looked he,        And he was all he looked.  She led him to the village green,  Where in desponding mood was seen        My _whole_, with drooping head.  “Behold,” she said, “a perfect, true  And striking likeness, sir, of you!”        And, laughing, gaily fled.is solved by _Donkey_.14Lewis Carroll turns WHEAT into BREAD, changing one letter each time, andpreserving their general order throughout, thus--  WHEAT;

Inconsistencies in lay-out between the puzzles and their  solutions have not been standardised.  The source document has several pages that contain a Pictured Puzzle  at the top (Roman numerals) and one or more Word Play puzzles or jokes  (Latin numerals). This has been retained in this text; any  auto-generated Tables of Contents may therefore look jumbled up with  intermixed Roman and Latin numerals.  Depending on the hard- and software used to read this text and on  their settings, not all elements may display as intended. The larger  diagrams may be illegible on small screens or in small windows.  Where possible and relevant, illustrations have been “transcribed”,  occasionally discarding some of the ornamentation. In this e-text for  chess boards and the like, # indicates a dark square; dominoes are  represented either by the pattern of the pips or by the number of  pips. The transcribed illustrations usually give but a very simple  impression of the actual illustration. For reference and for the sake  of completeness, images of the transcribed illustrations have been  provided at the end of this e-book, with hyperlinks (“Image”) pointing  to them. Hyperlinks from these images point back to the riddle,  puzzle, etc. (“Return to description”) or to its solution (“Return to  solution”). In addition, hyperlinks are provided from the puzzles etc.  to their solutions (“Solution”) and from the solutions back to the  puzzle etc. (“Return to description”).  Table of Contents, page 130: The Enigmas, Charades, Puzzles, &c., &c.  do not actually start on this page (they start on page 2), but there  are no more Pictured Puzzles and Word Play from this page on.  Page 49, Se Pierot or Lun: possibly an error for See Pierot or L’un or  Le Pierot or L’un.  Page 60, No. LX: the description is confusing, as the puzzle consists  of drawing the four dotted lines, and they are therefore not given.  Page 89 and 263, Pictured puzzle LXXXIX and solution: either the  puzzle or the solution has been printed upside-down in the source  document.  Page 114, ... as nearly as possible of the size and pattern ...: based  on the size of the physical book (around 7″ or 18 cm tall), the  boomerang’s width would be some 3″ or 7.5 cm.  Page 149, ... six single words: the solution provided gives five  single words.  Page 205, Solution IX: the table as printed lacks values for Opposite  pairs of short diagonals (of which there are four) and Such  combinations as 482, 484, 472, 470 (of which there ought to be two in  order to reach the given total).  Changes made  In the source document, jokes, riddles and puzzles may be split over  multiple pages (for example, Word Play 5 may be found on page 7 (first  part) and page 9 (second part)). In this e-text, the second part has  been re-combined with the first, and references to the separate first  and second parts have been deleted.  Some minor obvious typographical errors have been corrected silently.  Similarly, minor discrepancies (such as the number of blanks or                                                                    x  periods) have been rectified silently.

The  footnote has been moved to directly underneath the Word Play in which  it is referenced.  In some chessboard based riddles the symbol for knight has been  changed from Kt to N.  In some of the diagrams bold, italics or small capital mark-up of  individual words and letters has been removed due to the limited width  available.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tmProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety ofcomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. Itexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donationsfrom people in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm'sgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection willremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and futuregenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, seeSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page atwww.gutenberg.orgSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive FoundationThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of thestate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the InternalRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identificationnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted byU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and upto date contact information can be found at the Foundation's websiteand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contactSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive withoutwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SENDDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particularstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donateWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donationmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. Todonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donateSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic worksProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the ProjectGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could befreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced anddistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network ofvolunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paperedition.Most people start at our website which has the main PG searchfacility: www.gutenberg.orgThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
