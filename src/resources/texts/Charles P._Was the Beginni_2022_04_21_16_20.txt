BOWDITCHCAMBRIDGETHE UNIVERSITY PRESS1901WAS THE BEGINNING DAY OF THE MAYA MONTH NUMBERED ZERO (OR TWENTY) ORONE?Goodman, in his elaborate and valuable book on the Maya Inscriptions,has made up his Tables on the supposition that the beginning day of themonth was not called Day 1, but Day 20, giving the day this numberbecause in his view the Mayas counted the number of days which hadpassed and not the current or passing day. That is, the Mayas,according to Goodman, used the same plan in counting their days whichwe use in counting our minutes and hours and which we depart from incounting our days. Thus, when we speak of January 1, we do not meanthat one day has passed since January came in, but that the month ofDecember has passed and that we are living in the day which whencompleted will be the first day of January. But when we say that it isone o'clock, we do not mean that we are living in the hour which whenpassed will be the first hour of the day or half-day, but we mean thatone whole hour of the day or half-day has fully passed. Goodman's ideais that the Mayas used this system in counting their days of the month,their kins, uinals, tuns, katuns, and cycles. In other words heconsiders that the beginning day of the month Pop was not 1 Pop, but 20Pop, the beginning day of Uo was 20 Uo; that the beginning kin of auinal was Kin 20, the beginning uinal of a tun was Uinal 18, thebeginning tun of a katun was Tun 20, that the beginning katun of acycle was Katun 20, and that the beginning cycle of a grand cycle wasCycle 13. The reason why Goodman substitutes 18 and 13 for 20 in thecase of the uinals and cycles respectively is that these are thenumbers of uinals and cycles which are needed to make one of the nexthigher units in his scale of numeration.Without considering the truth or error of his view in regard to thecycles, katuns, etc., let us try to solve the following questions:1st. Did the Mayas count the days of their month by the day which hadpassed, as we count our hours?2d. Was the number which they gave to the beginning day of the month 0or 20?For our answers to these questions, let us turn to pages 46-50 of theDresden Codex. These pages contain three rows of twenty month dateseach, and each of these dates is reached with but two exceptions bycounting forward from the preceding date the number of days specifiedin red at the bottom of the pages, the first date of each row on page46 being the regular number of days distant from the last date of thesame row on page 50.In the first row of dates, we find that the third date on page 48 is 12Chen. The number of days at the bottom of the page which need to becounted forward in order to reach the fourth date is 8. If thebeginning day of the month were marked by the Mayas with 1, then thelast day would be marked with 20, and by adding 8 days to 12 Chen, weshould reach 20 Chen. But the date is not 20 Chen. The month isYax,--the month immediately following Chen,--and the glyph which takesthe place of the number has a form resembling two half-circles placedside by side. In other words, in this case 8 days from 12 Chen reach ?Yax, and as far as the first proposition is concerned, it is immaterialwhether the form above given is called 0 or 20. Eight days have takenus out of the month Chen into the next month Yax, and to a day of thatmonth which is not 1 Yax, but must be a day preceding 1 Yax, whetherthat is called 0 Yax or 20 Yax.Again, the first date of the first row of month dates on page 50 is 10Kankin, and the number at the bottom of the page to be added in orderto reach the second date is 90. Counting forward 90 days from 10 Kankinwe should reach 20 Cumhu, if the beginning day of the month is 1Cumhu. But the month is not Cumhu nor is it Pop, but it is undoubtedlythe glyph for the five supplementary days, Uayeb. The glyph which takesthe place of the number is the same as that which has just been foundbefore Yax. This is additional evidence that the months began with 0 or20 and not with 1.Again, on the first date of the second row of page 50 is 15 Cumhu, andthe number of days to be added in order to reach the next date is 90,which appears at the bottom of the page. Counting forward this numberof days from 15 Cumhu, we should reach 20 Zotz if the beginning day ofthe month were 1 Zotz. But the month is clearly Tzec, and the number isthat which we have already found twice before as meaning 0 or 20.These cases would seem to show that after passing day 19 of any month,we reach the beginning day of the next month, and that this day isfound with the glyph which means 0 or 20.Against this is the evidence of the last month date of the third row ofpage 49, which is clearly 9 Mac, and the number to be added at thebottom of the page is 236. This would take us to 20 Xul, if thebeginning day of Xul is 1 Xul, but to 0 or 20 Yaxkin if the beginningday of Xul is 0 or 20. The first month date of the third row of page 50is 0 or 20 Xul. This, I think, is clear, although the Xul glyph is notexactly like the other glyphs of this month.Here then are three cases which support Goodman's view and one againstit. The weight of evidence is therefore in favor of his system so far.In the Inscriptions there are not very many cases where the month hasthe zero or twenty sign attached to it, and there are still fewer caseswhere this occurs in a position where the question can be decided fromthe context as to whether the 0 or 20 is the last day of one month orthe beginning day of the next month.On the inscription of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque, however, wehave a month date which is 5 Ahau 3 Tzec. This is on R S 10. On R 8 to9 we find 1.16.7.17., if the thumb with the katun glyph means 1, as italmost surely does. Counting forward this number of days from 5 Ahau 3Tzec, we should reach 5 Caban 20 Zip if the month begins with 1, or 5Caban 0 or 20 Zotz if the beginning day is 0 or 20. On S 12 R 13 is 5Caban 0 or 20 Zotz. The form of the number glyph cannot fail to recallthat of the similar glyphs in the Dresden Codex.De Rosny has given in his "Compte-Rendu d'une Mission Scientifique,"published in the "Mémoires de la Société d'Ethnographie," an admirablereproduction of the wooden inscription which came from Tikal. On Plate12 of this work we find on A B 1, 3 Ahau 3 Mol, and on B 2 A 3, we have2.11.12. By counting forward this number of days from 3 Ahau 3 Mol wereach 6 Eb 0 or 20 Pop, if the month begins with 0 or 20, but 6 Eb 5Uayeb if the month begins with 1. This is a particularly strong case,for the month is surely Pop and the number is certainly not 5, and islike those of the manuscripts and of the Temple of the Cross, which wehave just commented on and which are in all probability 0 or 20.Again, on a part of a doorway in El Cayo, on C D 3 we find 13 Cimi 19Zotz; on H 3 G 4 is a number which seems to be 8.18.6. Counting forwardwe reach 9 Eb 20 Uo, if the month begins with 1, or 9 Eb 0 or 20 Zip,if the months begin with 0 or 20. Although the glyphs for Uo and Zipresemble each other, yet the date on I J 1 is clearly 9 Eb 0 or 20 Zip.It should be said, however, that the number on H 3 G 4 is somewhateffaced and very unusual, in showing 18 uinals, and that there isanother date 5 ? 3 Yaxkin on E F 3.On the other hand the inscription of the Temple of the Cross shows uson D 3 C 4, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, and on D 5 C 6, is 1.9.2., which is equalto 1 year 177 days. Counting forward this number of days from 4 Ahau 8Cumhu we reach 13 Ik 20 Mol, if the month begins with 1, or 0 or 20Chen, if the month begins with 0 or 20. On C D 9 we find 13 Ik ? Mol.However, on D 13 to C 15 we have the long number 1.18.3.12.0., whichcounted forward from 13 Ik 20 Mol brings us to 9 Ik 15 Zac, which isnot found anywhere near by. But if we count forward this number from 13Ik 0 or 20 Chen, we should reach 9 Ik 15 Ceh, which is found on E F 1.It would seem, therefore, that the glyph for Mol had been carved inerror for that of Chen.Other cases where 0 or 20 probably occur before the month sign are thefollowing:Copan,         Altar U,  1 to  2     2 Caban 0 or 20 Pop.  "              "   U, 51 to 52     3 Eb    0 or 20 Pop.Temple of the Cross, Q   2 P   3    11 Caban 0 or 20 Pop.  "    "  "    "     F  12 E  13     9 Ik    0 or 20 Chen (J.T.G.)  "    "  "    "     E F 9           9 Ik    0 or 20 Yax or Zac.The month glyph of the last example looks like Zac. If it is Yax itproves Goodman's theory by calculation.Thus we see that in three out of four cases in the Dresden Codex and inthree cases out of four in the Inscriptions where the context is suchas to throw light on the question, the evidence is in favor ofconcluding that the months began with a day 0 or 20 and not with a day1. Moreover in the single case in the Codex which tends to prove thecontrary, it is interesting to see that the month glyph, Xul, issomewhat different from the other Xul glyphs, while in the doubtfulcase in the inscriptions, if the month glyph had been Chen and not Mol,it would have agreed with the dates before and after it. In otherwords, the calculations both before and after the date in questionwould be quite accurate if the month were Chen and if, therefore, thebeginning day were 0 or 20, while the glyph of Mol makes thecalculation after that date inaccurate.All the evidence taken gives a very strong presumption in favor ofGoodman's theory that the month began with 0 or 20.It is also interesting to notice that of the other dates given abovewhere the calculation does not help us, three of these are 0 or 20 Pop(provided we have identified the number glyph correctly, which iscertainly none of the known glyphs for any of the numbers 1 to 19).This date would not be significant if 20 Pop were the last day of themonth, but it would be very significant if it were the beginning day ofthe month, that is the beginning day of the New Year. I think,therefore, that it is safe to assume as a good working hypothesis thatthe beginning days of the month were designated as 0 or 20, and thelast day of the month as 19.The second of our questions,--namely, whether this beginning day wascalled Day 0 or Day 20,--must now be taken up. Of course if we haddecided that those cases which we have been considering represented thelast days of the month, there would have been no question that thenumber glyphs which were not any of the numbers from 1 to 19 must bethe number 20. It would have been very improbable that after havingnumbered the days of a month from 1 to 19 they would have called thelast day 0. But it is not as certain that they might not have calledthe beginning day of a month 20, considering that twenty days hadpassed of the preceding month, and that their count was regulated bythe number of days which had passed. As far as the month dates areconcerned, however, it is absolutely unimportant whether the beginningday is called 0 or 20. Goodman says that the Mayas had no need of azero (following the Romans in this respect), since zero was of no useas a multiplier. This is hardly conclusive. It may be true, as Goodmansays, that the Mayas in their month dates spoke of the twenty dayswhich had passed in the preceding month; but it is equally true thatthey may have expressed this idea by attaching the number zero to thebeginning day on the ground that no days of the current month hadelapsed. Indeed the latter explanation is the more credible, since, ifthey had spoken of the twenty days of the preceding month as havingelapsed, it would seem possible at least, and perhaps probable, thatthey would have used the name of the preceding month as well, and wouldhave called the beginning day of Yaxkin, for instance, 20 Xul and not20 Yaxkin. But this it seems they did not do, unless the instance onthe Temple of the Cross and that of the Dresden Codex, already cited,would bear this construction. These instances, however, arecontradicted by all the other cases and are themselves capable of adifferent interpretation. It would seem as if the Mayas probably calledthe beginning day of a month by the name of the current month, and thatthey attached the zero to it, meaning that no days of that month hadelapsed. Moreover such a plan is very much easier for calculation andthere is less liability to error; for it is natural to think of a daywith the number 20 as following a day with the number 19 and as beingthe last day of a month containing 20 days, rather than the beginningday of a month. I do not place too much reliance on this, however, forit is hardly safe to argue back from what we at this time wouldconsider the best thing to do, in order to find out what some othernation at some other time would have done.The chief evidence in favor of giving the 0 or 20 glyph the meaning of20 is, that this glyph is often drawn with a hand stretching across itslower part, especially when the main part of the glyph is a face. Nowthe face glyphs which represent the cycle of 144,000 days and the katunof 7,200 days are very similar, except that the cycle glyph has also ahand across its lower part, and the cycle is equal to 20 katuns; butthis evidence is somewhat weak, since it is clear that even if the 0or 20 glyph should be decided to mean 20, in all calculations it is tobe treated as 0, as is proved by many of the inscriptions of Palenque,Piedras Negras, Copan, and elsewhere.On the whole, therefore, I think the weight of evidence is in favor ofthe hypothesis that the Mayas called the beginning days of their monthDay 0 and numbered the days of their month from 0 to 19.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Was the Beginning Day of the MayaMonth Numbered Zero (or Twenty) or One?, by Charles P.

Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  ToSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for anyparticular state visit http://pglaf.orgWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donationmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donateSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.orgThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
