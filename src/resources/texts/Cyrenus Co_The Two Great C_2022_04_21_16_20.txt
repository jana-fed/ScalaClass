In the wheat country there is nothing impressive,except the magnificent distances. As far as the eye can reach, andthat is very far, one sees a level expanse, covered with wheat, somein the shock and some still on the stalk. The towns, also, lackimpressiveness. Most of them are mere wheat stations. Fargo andBismarck and Mandan are, however, not without commercial and historicinterest.At Bismarck, I recalled what Mr. Bryce wrote in “The AmericanCommonwealth.” He was present, in 1883, when the corner stone of thestate house was laid, with imposing ceremonies, General U. S. Grantand “Sitting Bull” being among the honored guests. Mr. Bryce recordsthat one of the orators upon that occasion remarked that Bismarck wasdestined to “be the metropolitan hearth of the world’s civilization.”Mr. Bryce says he asked why the state house was “not in the city,” but“a mile off, on the top of a hill in the brown and dusty prairie,” andhe was told, by the enthusiastic spirits of the place, that in a fewyears that hill would be the center of the city that was to be. But thestate house still stands out of town. Many hopes in real estate areunrealized, but let us hope they have only been deferred. A hundredyears from now all the open country may be teeming with populations. Inmuch of the wheat country there are no country homes, only places inwhich the wheat growers live long enough to plant and to gather theircrops. The wheat fields end in the Bad Lands, and these would not beso interesting, were they not so dreary. On the Little Missouri onebegins to see patches of alfalfa. It was on this river that TheodoreRoosevelt ranched, equipped with a college diploma and his indomitablespirit. One ascends gradually into the mountains, up the YellowstoneRiver, to Livingston, where they break the transcontinental journeyfor the Yellowstone National Park trip. It is fifty-five miles fromLivingston to Gardner and five or six miles from Gardner to the MammothSprings Hotel, the last five miles being covered by stages.The hotel is crowded. People are coming and going. They jostle eachother and rush about frantically, looking for baggage and worried aboutmany things. Those who have “done” the Park are anxious to get away,and those who are about to “do it” are as anxious to be on their way.All sorts and conditions of people are here, the aged and the young,the rich and the poor, women always predominating in numbers and inactivity. The postal card fad is at its height here. The postage thatis paid on these trifles ought to pay the government a dividend on themoney it has invested in the Park.II.Yellowstone National Park, Old Faithful Inn, August 15: It has beenraining in the Park. The weather has been lowering before a blusteringwind, with snow and sleet. People sat shivering in the stage coachestoday, but they tell us we are more fortunate than those who have beencompelled to make the journey in the dust. Mr. Jones and Mr. Pope camein dusters, but they have donned their overcoats, instead. Every onewho has made the tour of the Park thinks he can tell you all about it,but the truth is that no one knows anything about the weather here, itis so variable and there is so much of it. It is clearing now and everyone is buoyant. It is sunshine after a storm that makes people happy,especially the women. They like sunshine.This inn is an interesting point in the journey. It is built entirelyout of logs, seven stories high, at the peak. It has great fire placesand a rustic dining room, where the food begins to taste “shippy.”In these places one’s appetite always craves the things that are notplaced before you. Resort hotels are the most contrary places in theworld. The name of the inn is taken from that of the geyser, thelargest now in action in the Park basin, Old Faithful, so named becauseit gives an exhibition every hour. The water is thrown a hundredfeet in the air and the spray that accompanies it, and the vapor,are beautiful to see. The basin, in front of the hotel, is filledwith miniature geysers and in whichever direction one looks he cansee vapor rising from crevices. In many places the crust is thin andtreacherous. Some of the pools have the most delicate formations andthe most exquisite colorings, comparable with nothing except the colorsin precious stones. Some are green and some are blue and some are likemorning glories. The smell of sulphur is in the air. There are also theugly things, mud geysers, unwholesome holes bubbling with and spoutingout mud, like toads. Some people insist on seeing every crevice. Theytramp about until they are all tired out. That is what they call“doing” the Park. The poor Park, and the poorer mortals! But to me itseems easier and better to sit down quietly and absorb the spirit ofthings. The mountains clad with the green timber, the rich blue sky,fleeced with delicate clouds, over all. It is a great joy to be in themidst of these natural wonders. Why weary one’s self with the details?Why make it a place of weariness? It is a great picture gallery ofthe gods. Here they have left unfinished the work of creation. Butpeople go through it, rushing about it as about bargain counters in thestores.III.Yellowstone National Park, Lake Hotel, August 15, 1908: We leftOld Faithful Inn this morning with some regrets. One could spendseveral days there with profit. The inn itself is comfortable and thesurroundings attractive. We have had the misfortune to be overtakenby a party of excursionists, who entered the Park from the west. Anexcursionist is an uninteresting traveler. He is apt to be some one whois traveling because the rates are cheap. The regular tourists werevery much put out by the overcrowding. But if one wants to be alone, orwith a few friends, he must not follow the beaten paths of the Park.There are many ways of traveling in vogue. The easiest way is by thestages of the transportation company, which owns and operates thehotels. In the hotels one is apt to get a good bed and, sometimes, abath. The food served in the dining rooms is of the conventional hotelvariety. All the supplies are brought into the Park in heavy freightwagons. Most of the things are taken out of cans, but a few freshvegetables are supplied from gardens cultivated by the hotel company.The milk also is fresh, drawn from cows kept in the Park. Cheapermodes of travel and subsistence are supplied by camping outfits. Onecompany maintains a series of permanent camps, and others use movablecamps, carrying all their bedding and their utensils with them fromplace to place. But whichever way one travels, he is apt to pick upmany friends. Friendships, in fact, are easily made in the Park. Forthe time they seem very real, and partings at the end of a journey seemalmost like partings with old friends. It all comes from the fact thatthe people one meets here are, for the time being, all the people thereare in this little miniature world.But we are still leaving Old Faithful Inn, so far as this letter isconcerned. The regrets that many felt in leaving the inn were increasedby the disagreeableness of the weather outside. It was a miserablerainy morning. It drizzled all the time and, intermittently, there weredownpours of water. It fell to my lot to ride on the outside of thecoach, with the driver, which is a very choice seat in fair weather.When it is rainy, the ladies, and the ladies’ men always prefer to rideinside. But there is so much chattering inside, often about nothing,that a quiet man prefers to be outside, even in the rain. The driveris a good fellow. He does not talk much. He is too intent on watchinghis horses moving on a slippery road, often around abrupt curves. Thefour fine chestnut horses were real good company, so intelligent and sowilling and so eager. It was hard work this morning to pull the coach,for there was a gradual ascent, from one hundred to two hundred feet tothe mile. Plenty of clear water was running in the mountain streams. Wecrossed the continental divide, at an elevation of about 8,300 feet,but we soon recrossed the line and found ourselves once more on theAtlantic slope. The driver pointed out many objects of interest, amongthem Shoshone Lake, resting in the laps of mountain peaks, a beautifulbody of water. But the persons inside the coach seemed oblivious tomany things, except the mileposts which they counted, audibly, withgreat regularity--there were thirty-four of them to count to the nextlodging place. And it rained all the time!It was on this part of the journey that I learned most about theanimal life in the Park. It was one of the things in which the driverwas interested. There is all manner of life in the Park, from weaselsto antlered deer and bear, and in the air, birds from the tiniestcreatures picking their livings in the pine trees, to the statelywaterfowls that strut about in seven league boots. All the birds andanimals; all the creatures that crawl and burrow in the earth, or thatfly in the air, are protected by the omnipotent arm of the governmentin Washington. The soldiers who patrol the Park are the only ones whoare allowed to bring guns into the preserve. Not a shot is fired tobreak the stillness of the surroundings. The squirrels romp in the treetops and the beavers carry on their prodigious works just as they didbefore there was a man on this continent. Here the foxes have holesin the ground and the birds have nests in the trees, and there is noone to disturb them. The results are wonderful. The birds and animalshardly know what fear is, they seem so greatly unconcerned about thepresence of passing people. Here they find                      “_No enemy  But winter and rough weather_,”and of these they find a great deal during the winter months. Thetinges of winter are already in the air, even in August, for wintercomes early on this high elevation and when it comes it is severe, themercury falling to forty degrees below zero and the snow piling up todepths of ten or twelve feet.On our thirty-four mile journey we were shown many objects of interest,pools the bottoms of which rival the rarest flowers and gems in theircolorings. But also some ugly things, mud geysers, filthy and badsmelling. At noon we halted for luncheon at one end of the YellowstoneLake, and some persons took boats, making the rest of the day’s journeyby water. We reached the Lake Hotel at about four o’clock in theafternoon, tired enough to appreciate the comforts and hospitalitiesof the place. This hotel is one of the best in the Park, lightedby electricity and heated with steam, the rooms all cheerful ones.The meals in the dining room, also, were good. The lake itself is awonderful body of water, considering its extent and its elevation.The tops of the mountains stand all around it. It lies in the hollowsformed between mountain ranges. But aside from these features, it isnot more interesting than other bodies of water.After the rains, the sun went down in mountain splendors. How good itseemed to see the light flooding through the breaking clouds! We havebeen very anxious about the sun for tomorrow is our day at the Canyonof the Yellowstone and there, if anywhere, one needs the sun to bringout the colors. I have heard so much about this Canyon, since comingto the Park, and read so much about it before coming here, that I amvery anxious to see it and to measure it with my expectations. So far,I must confess, nothing has exceeded my expectations, and much hasfallen far below them. The things as they are, often play havoc withthe things as we have imagined them.IV.Yellowstone National Park, Canyon Hotel, August 16: We were notdisappointed in the weather today. A rarer Sunday morning never dawned,not even in the mountains. There were still some remnant clouds in thesky. Fortunately, too, these did not disappear entirely. All day bitsof fleecy clouds floated between the sun and the earth, not enough todarken, but just enough for contrasts. The air was bracing and therewas plenty of it.As usual, our coach led all the rest. Forty or fifty came trailingbehind. Every one was filled with persons in high glee and in greatexpectations. The road was a winding one along the Yellowstone River,up ridges and dipping down into hollows, with many a curve and a fewshort angles, the rolling and tumbling river nearly always in sight.The river is the outlet for the lake, or rather, the lake is but anextension, in width, of the river, forming a large reservoir forthe waters from the mountains and from the springs, thus insuring aconstant flow for the river.After leaving the lake, the waters in the river flow on as they do inany other river, leisurely and calmly. The water is wonderfully clear,coming from the snows in the mountains. The rocky bottoms of the riverare visible from the tops of the coaches and fishes may often be seenswimming and darting about. Across the river there is a gradual ascentof ground, until it forms a skyline of miniature mountain peaks. Thereare vast mountain meadows clothed in grays and browns, autumn colorsmingled with the colors of the sage. It makes an indescribable colorand the effect of it also is an indescribable one. On our own side ofthe river we are riding through endless beds of flowers, the kind ofbeds that nature makes in a large and liberal country. Their colorsare blue and purple and red. Of mountain daisies, yellow flowers ondelicate stems, there are millions. The flowers alone would be worthcoming to see, to say nothing of the furzy mountain meadows, like vastoriental rugs spread out by the hand of a generous God!The water in the river is green, when it flows over beds of moss andblack and foreboding when it runs under the shadows of the overhangingrocks. As we proceed on our journey, these projecting rocks become morenumerous. The banks gradually grow more precipitous and the channel,narrower. The waters grow more disturbed. Signs of some impendingcatastrophe to the river multiply. The waters now roll and surge. Fromside to side they dash themselves against the rocks, filling the airwith a spray. The river becomes furious and it makes a great commotion.Finally, in one great dash the waters rush over the upper falls, adistance of one hundred and ten feet down. Then, imprisoned in a narrowgorge, seething and foaming and roaring, they rush forward until theycome to the lower falls, where they make a spectacular descent of threehundred and six feet, filling the air with foam and spray and the scenewith glory, all the way down. The whole thing is God-like, that is theonly phrase that can describe it. God-like in power, in beauty and inmajesty.The lower falls is the beginning of the greater glory of theYellowstone river. At the bottom of the gorge the tumultuous waterscontinue on their way, so far down that what is a river looks likea yellow ribbon. From the river bed the gorge widens and makes themagnificent spectacle of the Canyon of the Yellowstone river. If such agorge had been cut in the dullest stone, it would be an awe-inspiringthing, but cut through rocks of the brightest hues the scene isbewildering, amazing and enthralling. And the longer you look at it,the more the wonder grows. What at first appears to be a wild riot ofcolors, yellow predominating, becomes a fabric of the most delicatecolorings, blended as nature blends colors and softened as time softensthem. There is no color and no shade that is missing. There is as muchthere as the eye has time or capacity to develop. No one has seen itall, no one will ever see it all. Each man sees but a fraction and afragment of it. All the eyes of the world cast into one with all timeat its command could not exhaust the possibilities of the combinationsin forms and colors.Here, I thought, is the one place where no traveler can bedisappointed, no dreamer disillusioned. Here the things that are, aremore than the things imagined. This is the transformation scene ofall the earth. This is the one great masterpiece in nature, perfect inall its details, endless in all its combinations of colors and forms,imposing in its grandeur. As I looked at it, I felt that nature hadnothing more to say to me and that in the way of scenery my heart hadnothing more to long for. Here is the throne of majesty in the templeof the beautiful. With unuttered thoughts in his mind and unfinishedsentences on his lips, one must turn away from the Canyon of theYellowstone.Monday morning, when we rode away from the scene, a dense fog hungover the river. Others were coming where we were leaving. Our day’sjourney was back to the Mammoth Springs Hotel. For us the Park was afinished book, however many the pages which we had skipped, and howeverimperfectly we may have read the few passages that fell under our eyes.Streams and meadows, cliffs and mountain peaks covered with snow, linedthe way outward bound, but it seemed to me that, somehow, the fallingof the waters and the glimmering of the colors of the Canyon, dimmedall other things.VSeattle, Washington, August 19: After spending a few hours inLivingston, which has a sightly location, at the mouth of a canyon andin sight of a mountain on which the snow lies for ten months in theyear, we proceeded westward. From Montana we passed into Idaho, wherethe tree butchers are cutting up the last remnants of the white pine.It is, for the most part, a dreary country, where the timber has beencut over and where forest fires have left masses of charred stumpage.Waste everywhere and nothing but waste! The American lumberman in thepast has picked out the best and left the rest to the desolation thatfollows the man with the axe and the torch. It has been the working outof the practical American idea of getting the most money with the leastcare about the future. It is pity and disgust and indignation that onefeels. But such are the ravages of commerce in a commercial era amonga commercial people.The next day we reached Spokane, on the other side of the Rockies,mistress of a vast industrial area, reaching up into the mountains onone side, with their mines and their lumber, and stretching out overthe Washington wheat fields, on the other. A great city, the creationof a few years, but to the casual traveler, more or less uninteresting,broiling and sizzling in the August sun, treeless, for the most part,and to that extent cheerless. But the volume of business transacted islarge and the business buildings are fine and the people, grown richer,are building new houses and surrounding themselves with the luxurieswhich American people everywhere seek after and prize.Leaving Spokane, going westward, one enters the great wheat country, aplateau lying between the Rocky Mountains and the coast ranges. Wherethe railroads run, the country is more or less rough, with here andthere formations that suggest “bad lands,” but much of the country islevel and productive. It is a vast treeless region; rainless in summer.The mercury rises as high as 100 in the night time. When the windblows, which it is apt to do, dust fills the air. Much of the soilseems to be as fine as flour and very light when it is very dry. Werode for hours without seeing a drop of water, in creek or lake. What aprecious thing water must be to the people--in summer time, when theyneed it most! There are no homes in these wheat fields. Here and thereare scattered hovels which the sowers and the reapers use in theirseasons, but no permanent abodes. Wire fences are stretched across thefields, far apart. How different it all is from the farming countriesof the Mississippi Valley, with their well fenced farms, the homes ofthe farmers in the midst of groves and orchards and the grazing herdsof cattle and flocks of sheep. Here and there one saw a horseman ridingin a pillar of dust. The trails of dust one sees are the only evidencesof highways, or of travel. It is a great wheat producing country, whenit has been revived by the rains of winter, but the men who grow thatwheat ought to be well paid for their labors. It was night when wereached the Columbia River, the mighty stream that wends across thesewheat fields, deep down in its channel, so deep that the use of itswaters for purposes of irrigation seems almost hopeless. The winds thatblow across the plateau may solve the question.Seattle is a marvel in the way of city building. It is growing in everydirection and in every way. Located on a great inland sea, in sight ofthe mountains and blest with a climate of wonderful evenness, at theend of the great transcontinental railways and where the large vesselsare loaded and unloaded for the orient and the coastwise trade, thedestiny of this city can hardly be overdrawn. Seattle has absorbedthe major energies of the American northwest. The men who founded thecity laid out its streets in almost impossible places, but modernengineering is cutting down the hills and filling up the hollows. Thereis no end to the enterprise of the people in these respects. Everybreath one breathes in Seattle is a city breath. Men from the prairiesof Iowa have become city builders in Seattle. Industrial reverses mayovertake them, they likely will, and their winters are said to beatrociously foggy and wet, but they are going to make Seattle a placeof which all Americans will be proud, one of the great commercialcities of the Pacific Ocean.VISan Francisco, August 24: After spending a few days in Seattle westarted southward, with Los Angeles as the end of our journeying inthat direction. Tacoma has been out-distanced by Seattle, but it isitself a great and growing city. Portland, in Oregon, is a city ofolder appearances than Seattle. It has more leisure and more cultureand, perhaps, more realized riches. It has a great river, mountainsaround it and the ocean only a few miles away. Portland is building forthe future and the growth of Pacific Ocean commerce is in the dreams ofall the business men.On the way to San Francisco we rode up the Rogue River valley, whichwe found not equal to its fame, and around Mount Shasta, grand andglorious in the sunshine that fell around its snow-covered peak. Thenext morning we were in the wheat belt of California, the wonderfulSacramento Valley. In August it is barren enough, nothing green init except the fields of alfalfa, an occasional plum orchard and thewonderful live oaks scattered over the landscapes, always with therange of mountains in the perspective. Wheat growing in these valleyshas about reached its limit. The continual cropping has left the soilimpoverished and there is talk of cutting up the big ranches intoindividual small farms, watered artificially. What there may come outof this form of development is problematical. Some persons who hadlived in the valley assured us that the heat is often so intense thatit scalds the fruit on the trees. On the western slope of the coastrange the climate is much better for fruit and also for gardening.Incidentally, it may be remarked that the American is hardly therace that will develop this form of intensive farming. They want todo things on a bigger scale and they shun the manual labor that isnecessary to make it successful. Portuguese colonies are said to beprospering in the culture of fruit and the Japanese also are makingheadway. They are willing to do such work and to do it for wages thatare not considered adequate by Americans. Under present conditionsnothing seems to me more hopeless than the establishment of fruitfarms, by American farmers from the Mississippi Valley, in thevalley of the Sacramento, the Rogue River or even the Yakima and theYellowstone.San Francisco has recovered marvelously from the earthquake and thefire. It is a city in the process of rebuilding and the rebuildingis all along greater and better lines. Old Chinatown is no longer acity of rookeries, but of substantial brick and steel, with shops thatwould do credit to any city. The haunts of vice are fewer and theold devotees of oriental vices complain bitterly that the “town” haslost its “atmosphere.” If it has, it is so much for the better. SanFrancisco has been hampered and handicapped, but its business men arestriving to retain the commerce of the Pacific for which so many othercities are now striving and for which Seattle has made so much headway.VIILos Angeles, August 27: At San Francisco our party was broken up. Mr.Jones and I proceeded to Los Angeles, while Mr. and Mrs. Pope electedto linger longer in that city and to make many breaks in their journey,to visit the seaside resorts.Southern California in August is not an inviting place. There isdrouth, and dust. The famed orchards are simply patches of trees inplowed ground, the trees covered with dust as well as with ripeningfruit. When we think of orchards at home, we think of beautiful platsof grass, with trees. But that is not the California idea. They arefar from being sylvan dreams. They are places for hard work and, fromall reports, meager incomes. To pick and pack peaches for distantmarkets is laborious and hazardous. The vineyards were filled withdistress over grapes at six dollars a ton. But in the real estateoffices in Los Angeles, rosier views of fruit growing were to be hadand that freely. Los Angeles is city mad. They have done wonders andthey think of the future without dismay. All things seem possible tothe promoters. On the one side they have “the back country” where theproducts are going to enrich all the people and on the other side theyhave the ocean on which they are going to carry the commerce of theorient, all paying tribute to Los Angeles. The ocean, at Long Beachand other points is beautiful, restful and invigorating, but the greatships have found no harbors in the vicinity of Los Angeles. The harborsmust be made artificially and the commerce must be wrested away fromSan Francisco, Portland and Seattle and Tacoma. It will be a greatstruggle for supremacy. No American can ride down this great Pacificcoast line without feelings of pride in the developments of thiswestern country. It is all American, intensely American. They call itthe Golden West, but the man who has to work for a living finds theconditions no easier here than “back east.” In many places he finds itharder, for he has Japanese competition and the climate of which theyboast so much makes men lazy.VIIIEl Tovar, Grand Canyon, Arizona, September 3: We left Los Angelesyesterday morning. It was without any regrets that we turned our faceshomeward. California in September has no charms that can be comparedwith those of September in Iowa.From Los Angeles to San Bernardino is a matter of two hours, throughthe San Gabriel Valley, one of the famous valleys of the state. Wewere rather disappointed. Where we had expected to see an unbrokensuccession of cultivated groves and gardens, we found half of the landstill in sage brush. Like most of the far west, the land is cultivatedin spots only. They said there was not enough water for all the fields.After leaving San Bernardino we went through a mountain pass andemerged, early in the afternoon, on the fringes of the Mojave desert,perhaps the dreariest area on the American continent. Hundreds ofmiles of utter barrenness! The famous Death Valley, 400 feet below thetop of the ocean, is part of this desert. It is on this journey thatone learns the value of water. Water, the great alchemist, the creatorand sustainer of life. How men and women follow the water, here in thesemi-arid west! There is no place in the mountains where a bit of astream trickles down that human beings are not found. A little house, alittle garden, and a cow, all gathered about that bit of water which isall of life to them. In these regions water is everything and even realestate men do not sell land, but water. A hot, dusty, disagreeable ridethis is, through the Mojave desert. Nothing of the kind could be worse.We were favored, too, for all afternoon thunder clouds were toyingwith mountain peaks, black clouds and vivid lightning and the deepreverberations of thunder--all so suggestive of copious falls of water,but only once did our train succeed in overtaking one of these showers.And of what use is a shower in a desert?We retired for the night, after we had passed the Needles, on theColorado River, between California and Arizona. When we arose in themorning we were in a green country again. The desert had faded away andtrees and flowers had come in again. Strange freak of nature, that theclouds should pass over the intervening desert and drop their moisturein central Arizona, where July and August are the rainy months of theyear. It was good to see the trees again, the big trees, and the grassand the flowers in the green fields. Our train reached Williams earlyin the morning. From Williams it is sixty miles to the rim of theCanyon, a side journey which one can make in the comfort of a Pullmancar. I had heard so much about the Grand Canyon that I was afraid tolook at it, though now within a stone’s throw of it--afraid of beingdisappointed. The disillusionments had been so many on this westernjourney, so many things had proved to be less than they had beenreported in the guide books and in the letters of travelers that I wasminded to save one dreamed of great thing from the wrecks of travel,at least a little while longer. So we sat down to breakfast first--theGrand Canyon would wait.It was a beautiful morning, the heavens filled with sunshine, with justenough of autumn in it to give it a dreamy effect. Fifty steps fromthe hotel brought us to the rim of the canyon. Those fifty steps tookone into a new world. Unlike mountains and oceans, unlike anythingelse in the world, is this first view of the great gorge which iscalled the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. In that first momentone is bewildered--and still disappointed. One had anticipated a moreinstantaneous grandeur. But what is a first look here? Nothing, welearned afterwards. It is nothing more than a blinding of the eyes,a numbing of the senses. Before one lies an unutterable immensity ofthings that is appalling. You think you see everything, and yet yousee nothing. You simply realize that you are looking on somethingthat is beyond you, out of your grasp, out of your reach, beyond yourcomprehension. There is a certain dizziness in the air that you lookthrough. The earth has suddenly opened up before you and instead ofseeing mountains lifted in the air you see them in the earth beneathyou. Everything is at first without form and void. It is a dream, afantasy of the mind. But as you linger and look longer, graduallythings begin to assume forms and shapes and they begin to be real.Objects begin to express themselves in colors also, in great masses ofcolors, all colors and all variations of all colors. It is a creationthat is going on before you. The void begins to be filled with allmanner of formations. It is some such hour as when God said, “Let therebe light, and there was light.” In those first moments we are presentat another creation, and it is a creation, that is enacted for everyone who comes to partake of the glories of this canyon. To attempt todescribe it further would be like trying to weave a garland of rosesaround a star.The learned of the world, the poets, the painters and the writers havelingered on this same rim, not for a day, but for weeks, charmed,fascinated, bewildered, enthralled, but without being able to reproduceeither in colors or in words what they saw. Each one has picked up abit of color, where there are oceans of color. The scientist knowsthat through countless ages the waters of the Colorado River have cutthis gorge into the earth, through the solid rock and the driftingsand alike. It is a mile deep, thirteen miles from rim to rim and overtwo hundred miles long. At the bottom of the gorge flows the creatorof this wonderful masterpiece of nature, the Colorado River. It is adashing, roaring river, maddened in its fury to get to the level of theocean, through unnumbered obstructions, but of all the fury with whichit lashes its sides, there is not a murmur that reaches you standingat the rim of the canyon--the river is a mile below you and six milesaway. The deathlike stillness of dead ages hangs over the canyon.Before Christ was, before Adam was, this work was completed. Stilla mighty river, in those primeval days the Colorado must have beeninfinitely mightier to have removed the mountains that stood in itscourse. To wear away the solid stone, disintegrate it and, in solution,to carry it with its own waters to the ocean, that was the work thatthe Colorado River had to perform to make this bed for itself. Inthe Mojave desert the thought came to us, how precious is water, thelife of the world; here the thought comes to us, how mighty are thewaters when they are assembled together, the might of the world. Thereglistening in the rainbow above the barren mountain peaks; here roaringin their fury, dark and mirky and foreboding at the bottom of thegorge.As at the Yellowstone Canyon, so here every step brings a new view ofthe canyon. It is not the same from any two points of observation. Ofits mere immensity one can form no adequate idea. The opposite sidelooks hardly a mile off, but it is thirteen miles, in fact. All ofPike’s Peak might be tumbled into it and hardly make a dam to hold thewaters back. In the drowsiness of the afternoon’s sun I thought one ofthe mountains that stand in the bottom of the canyon looked like a hugepulpit. I thought I saw terrace rise above terrace, up the slopes, andfifty miles up and down the river. I thought how all the nations of theearth might be gathered there and seated, and how an archangel mightspeak to them and be heard by all. Not only terraces, but temples,pagodas, castles, battleships, everything that one has ever seen thatis great or grand seems to be reproduced in this canyon, in such variedways has the water chiseled itself upon the rocks. Every conceivableform of things, every imaginable color, has been worked out in thisgreat gorge. The sun goes down upon it, throwing the shadows of raggedpeaks across yawning chasms, multiplying the awfulness of things seen.The full sun can not light the depths of it. In the darkness of thenight one walks on the rim of this canyon as on the shores of someunexplored world, a world still in the process of creation.Day after day, little parties of sightseers go down into the canyon,down Bright Angel trail, on the backs of donkeys. It is thirteen milesby the trail and then the river is still far below them, so far thatthey can hardly hear the noise it makes between its rocky banks.Many had said that when one has seen the Grand Canyon he has forgottenall about the Canyon of the Yellowstone. But I did not find it so.Nothing can ever make me forget the Canyon of the Yellowstone. Thetwo canyons are so different and so distinct that comparisons arenot possible, but contrasts are. In the Grand Canyon the colors areheavier; in the Yellowstone Canyon the colors have the brightnessof the butterfly. The one is compact, the other immense. The oneis definite, conceivable and comprehensible; the other indefinite,inconceivable and incomprehensible. The one produces the sensations ofnearness and dearness; the other of aloofness and vagueness. The one islike a beautiful woman arrayed in many colors; the other like an angelclothed in austerity.When one has seen these two canyons, the west has nothing more to offerhim in the way of scenery. They sum up all the wonders that nature haswrought in these cyclopean regions of the continent. One wants to seethem again, to see them many times again. In the last year of his lifehe might desire to take a last look at them. And, if in the providenceof the theologians, we are all translated into angels, for one I shalloften be tempted to desert the glories celestial for these gloriesterrestial, to hover over the scene where the Yellowstone River tumblesover its precipices into the gorgeous depths below and where theColorado River roars at the bottom of the canyon which is the creationof its own might and fury.Transcriber’s NotesPage 29: “Portugese colonies” changed to “Portuguese colonies”*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TWO GREAT CANYONS ***Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in theUnited States without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tmProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety ofcomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. Itexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donationsfrom people in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm'sgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection willremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and futuregenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, seeSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page atwww.gutenberg.orgSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive FoundationThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of thestate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the InternalRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identificationnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted byU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and upto date contact information can be found at the Foundation's websiteand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contactSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive withoutwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SENDDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particularstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donateWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donationmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. Todonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donateSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic worksProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the ProjectGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could befreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced anddistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network ofvolunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paperedition.Most people start at our website which has the main PG searchfacility: www.gutenberg.orgThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
