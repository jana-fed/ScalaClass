Thesubjects were his active and good life and happy death. I am aware thatsome of my nearest friends thought it strange that my heart, on theoccasion of his death, was filled with a kind of joy rather than withsadness. To them I could merely say, that an event so calm, and undersuch circumstances of suffering as he then was, suggested to me nothinglike real sorrow. I wished my young companions to feel as I did, andthat, in their minds, a quiet death following a good life should beclothed with beauty, and that they might thus be led to believe that,in accordance with the Scotch proverb, “A gude life makes a gude end.At least it helps weel.” Horace Mann was present during the address.Being deeply interested in the education of the young, he requested meto prepare for his Common School Journal a sketch similar to that Ihad spoken. In accordance with that desire, a memoir was prepared, andafter its publication the Warren Street Chapel Association requestedthat it should be put, with some revision, into this form. And as it wasoriginally prepared for, and dedicated to, the pupils of that institution,                          SO I NOW DEDICATE IT                               ANEW TO THE                 GIRLS AND BOYS OF WARREN STREET CHAPEL.CONTENTS.                                                                      PAGE                               CHAPTER I.               _From 1773 to 1784—under 10 years of age._    Birth.—Childhood                                                    11                               CHAPTER II.           _From 1784 to 1795—between the ages of 10 and 21._    His apprenticeship, his habits.—Studies Chambers’s    Cyclopædia.—Results of his studies;

He died more than thirty years ago, in Boston;and, from having been a poor and ignorant boy, he became a man known allover the world for his great learning, while at the same time he wasbeloved for the goodness of his heart and the integrity of his character.May the perusal of his history excite some of you to imitate his virtuesand his energy.[Sidenote: BIRTHPLACE.][Sidenote: EARLY SCHOOL DAYS.]He was born in Salem, a town about fourteen miles from Boston, thecapital city of our State of Massachusetts. His birthday was March 26,1773. His father was at first a cooper, and afterwards a shipmaster.He and his wife were exceedingly poor, and they had many children. Natwas the fourth child. He had two sisters and three brothers. When hewas about two and a half years old, his parents removed to a very smallwooden house in Danvers, about three miles from Salem; and here the boyattended school for the first time, and began to show those generousfeelings, and that love of learning, which he displayed so much inafter-life. A few years ago the old school-house in which he learned tospell and read remained entire. It was an old-fashioned building, witha long, slanting roof, which, at the back of the house, nearly reachedthe ground. Its single chimney, with many curious and pretty corners,then rose in the middle of the roof, as it had for ninety years. Aroundthe dwelling is a grass plat, upon which he used, when a child likeyourselves, to play with his schoolmates. It was planted with shrubs,such as the farmers most need. The house in which he lived still standsnearly opposite that in which the school was kept. This house formerlyhad but two rooms in it, and all its furniture was of the simplest kind.[Illustration: HIS FIRST SCHOOL-HOUSE.][Sidenote: BROTHERS AND SISTERS.]I visited the relations of the schoolmistress. She died many, many yearsago; but her niece, when I asked about Nat Bowditch, told me how her auntused to love him for his earnestness in pursuing his studies, and for hisgentleness, while under her care. He was “a nice boy,” she used to say.While in Danvers, his father was most of the time at sea, he having beenobliged to give up his trade and become a sailor when the RevolutionaryWar broke out.[1] Nat lived, during his father’s absence, very happilywith his mother and his brothers and sisters. During the whole of hisafter-life, he used to delight to go near the small house in which hehad dwelt so pleasantly. The family was “a family of love.” He had abrother William, to whom he was very much attached. He was more grave andsober than Nat; for the latter, with all his devotion to study, was fullof fun, frolic, and good nature. But William was equally, and perhapsmore, gentle. The brothers frequently studied together from an old familyBible, and on Sundays, when they were quite small, their grandmother,who was a very excellent woman, used to place this large book, with itswooden covers and bright brazen clasps, upon the foot of her bed; andhour after hour did those two boys trace, with their fingers upon themap, the forty years’ wanderings of the Israelites, before they came intothe long-looked-for land of Canaan.[Sidenote: GRANDMOTHER’S BIBLE.][Sidenote: HIS MOTHER.]I have said that Nat frequently went to look upon the house in which hehad lived; and so he often called upon the family in which this old Biblewas kept, in order that he might see the volume which he had so lovedwhen a boy. It reminded him of the delightful home of his childhood,where his dear and worthy mother tried to make him good, in order thathe might become an honor to her and to the people. His mother was onewho was extremely kind; yet she was by no means afraid to correct herchildren, if she found them doing wrong. Nat sometimes suffered,because, like every boy, he sometimes did wrong; but generally the motherfound that he could be easily guided by her love. I seem to see her now,taking her little son, and leading him to the window of the cottage inDanvers, to see the beautiful new moon just setting in the west, while,at the same time, she kisses and blesses him, and talks to him of hisabsent father, and they both send up earnest wishes for his safe andspeedy return. She was very careful to instil into all her children theimportance of truth. “Speak the truth always, my boy,” said she. Shelikewise loved religion, and she was very liberal in her feelings towardsthose who differed from her upon this subject. Nevertheless, believingthat the Episcopal kind of worship was the most correct, she educatedall her children in that form. An anecdote which Nat, when he became aman, often related, will show you how much influence her instructions inthis particular had upon him. Among the Episcopalians the prayers areread, and the people repeat, aloud, some answer. One day Nat called hisbrothers and sisters around him, and, taking his mother’s Book of Prayer,with a sober face began to read aloud from it, while his brothers madethe answers. They had continued some minutes amusing themselves in thisway, when their mother entered the room. She was very much troubled atfirst, as she supposed they were ridiculing the services she held assacred. “My sons,” said she, “I am pleased to see you read that book; butyou should never do so in a careless manner.” They told her that, thoughplaying, they did not think to do any harm, or to show any disrespect.[Sidenote: EARLY POVERTY.][Sidenote: CHEERFULNESS UNDER IT.]The family was very poor; so poor, indeed, that sometimes they hadnothing to eat, for several successive days, but common coarse bread,with perhaps a little pork. Wheat bread was almost never allowed to anyone of them. Their clothing, too, was at times very thin. Frequently,during the whole winter, the boys wore their summer jackets and trousers.At times, Nat’s schoolmates used to laugh at him because he wore sucha thin dress, when they were wearing their thickest winter clothing.But he was not afraid of their merriment, nor made angry by it; on thecontrary, he laughed heartily at them for supposing him unable to bearthe cold. He knew that no good would be gained by complaints, and that hewould distress his mother if he made any; he therefore bore contentedlyhis want of clothing, and tried even to make himself merry with those whoridiculed him.[Sidenote: LOVE OF ARITHMETIC.][Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES.]At the age of seven years, and after returning to Salem, he went toa school kept by a man named Watson. Master Watson was one who hadsufficient learning for those times; though the boys who now go to schoolin Boston would think it very strange if a master did not attempt toteach more than he did. None of the scholars had a dictionary. MasterWatson was a good man, but he suffered much from headache, and thereforehe was liable to violent fits of anger; and when thus excited, as itgenerally happens in such cases, he was guilty of injustice. An instanceof this, young Bowditch met with, not long after he entered the school.From early life, Nat had liked ciphering, or arithmetic; and thinkingthat at school he would be able to learn something more about this thanhe had previously gained from his brothers, while at home, during thelong winter evenings, he requested the master to allow him to studyit. As he seemed too young, this request was not granted. But, beingdetermined to study what pleased him so much, he obtained a letter fromhis father, in which Mr. Bowditch requested Master Watson to allow hisson to pursue his favorite study. The schoolmaster, on receiving themessage, was very angry, and said to his pupil, “Very well. I’ll giveyou a sum that will satisfy you;” and immediately prepared a questionthat he thought Nat would be unable to answer, and which he could nothave answered had he not studied at home. But the boy had learned beforesufficiently to enable him to perform the task; and, having done so, heran gayly to the desk, expecting to be praised for his exact performanceof duty. You may imagine his surprise at being saluted with these words:“You little rascal, who showed you how to do this sum? I shall punishyou for attempting to deceive me.” The poor lad’s heart swelled and beatviolently. He blushed and trembled from fear of punishment, but stillmore at the suspicion which his instructor had expressed, that he hadbeen guilty of telling a lie. Filled with anger and alarm, he stammeredout, “_I_ did it, sir.” But his master would not believe him, and wasabout to strike him, when an elder brother interfered, and stated thatNat knew very well how to perform the task, for he himself had previouslytaught him enough to enable him to do it. Our young arithmetician thusescaped the punishment; but he never could forget that he had beenaccused of falsehood. His pious and truth-loving mother had so firmlyfastened in his mind the holiness of truth, that he rarely, if ever,thought of deviating from it; and during his life he considered thatany one who even suspected him of falsehood had done him the greatestinjury. How well it would be if all of our boys loved truth as he did![Sidenote: APPRENTICED TO SHIP-CHANDLER.]This was the only serious difficulty he met with while at this school.He was the same lively lad at everything he undertook as he had beenpreviously. He was beloved by his comrades for his good nature, and wasalways engaged in useful employment or innocent amusements. When he wasabout ten years of age, his father became poorer than ever; and moreover,in consequence of loss of regular employment and of the little propertywhich he possessed, he gave himself up to habits of intoxication. Fromhaving been a brave man, he became a coward, and, unable to look at thedistress of his family, made their poverty many times more burdensomeby habits which wholly unfitted him for active duties. Under thesecircumstances, his son, at the age of ten years and three months, leftschool, and soon afterwards was bound an apprentice to Messrs. Ropes andHodges, who kept a ship-chandler’s shop in Salem.[Sidenote: EARLY CHARACTER.]As this was one of the important times in his life, I think I willfinish this chapter with only two remarks, for the boys and girls who maybe reading this. You see a lively and good-natured boy, who, before hewas ten years old, showed great love of truth, much perseverance, a warmdesire for study, particularly of arithmetic; and lastly, you perceivehim under the influence of a good mother, who tries to excite in him alljust and holy sentiments. Particularly does she point out to him truth asone grand aim of his existence. Now, I wish you to remember these facts,and see where they eventually led him; and if you remember, you may beinduced to imitate him, at least in some respects.CHAPTER II._From 1784 to 1795—between the ages of 10 and 21._    His apprenticeship, his habits.—Studies Chambers’s    Cyclopædia.—Results of his studies; gains the respect of    all.—Dr. Bentley, Dr. Prince, and Mr. Reed, do him kindness; by    their means allowed access to “The Philosophical Library.”—He    makes philosophical instruments.—Calculates an Almanac at    the age of fourteen.—Studies algebra: delight he experienced    from this new pursuit.—Learns Latin.—Reads works by Sir Isaac    Newton.—Studies French.[Sidenote: CHANGE OF ABODE.][Sidenote: WORK AT THE SHOP.][Sidenote: THOUGHTFULNESS FOR OTHERS.]Doubtless it was with a sorrowing heart that Nat left his own dear homeand his kind mother to take up his abode among strangers; for he was tolive at the house of his employer, Mr. Hodges. But if he did feel sad,he was not one to neglect a duty in consequence of sorrow. The shop inwhich he was employed was situated very near the wharves, in the lowerpart of the town of Salem. We do not see many such stores now in Boston;though something similar is sometimes found in small country towns. Init a great variety of goods was sold, especially everything which wouldbe useful to a sailor. Pork and nails, hammers and butter, were kept inadjacent barrels. The walls were hung with all the tools needed in theseafaring life. There was a long counter in it, at one end of which Nathad his little desk. When not engaged with customers, he used to read andwrite there. He always kept a slate by his side, and, when not occupiedby the duties of the shop, he was usually busied with his favoritepursuit of arithmetic. In the warm weather of summer, when there waslittle business, and the heat was uncomfortable, he was often seen, bythe neighbors, engaged in ciphering, while resting his slate upon thehalf door of the shop; for in those days the shop doors were made in twoparts, so that frequently the lower half was shut, while the upper wasopen. Thus he was always actively employed, instead of being idle, as istoo frequently the case with boys in similar circumstances. Even on thegreat holidays of Fourth of July and “General Training,” he did not leavehis studies for the purpose of going to see the parade, but remained atthe shop, laboring to improve himself; or, if the shop was closed, hewas in his little garret-room at his employer’s house. Study and readingwere beginning to be his only recreation. Frequently, after the storewas closed at night, he remained until nine or ten o’clock. Many longwinter nights he passed in a similar manner, at his master’s house by thekitchen fire. While here, he did not become morose or ill-natured; butfrequently, when the servant girl wished to go to see her parents, wholived one or two miles off, he took her place by the side of the cradleof his master’s child, and rocked it gently with his foot, while busilyoccupied at his books. I think this was one of the sweetest incidentsin his early days. It was the germ of his benevolence in after-life. Atruly great man is kind-hearted as well as wise. Nat began thus earlyhis course of genuine humanity and science. So must you do if you wouldimitate him.[Sidenote: HIGHER STUDIES.]As he became older, he became interested in larger and more importantworks; and of these, fortunately, he found an abundant supply. Hisemployer lived in the house of Judge Ropes, and Nat had permissionto use the library of this gentleman as much as he wished. In thiscollection he found one set of books which he afterwards valued verymuch. He tried to buy a copy of it when he was old, having a similarfeeling towards it that he bore towards his grandmother’s Bible. Itwas Chambers’s Cyclopædia. As you may judge from the name Cyclopædia,these books, consisting of four very large volumes, contained much upona great many subjects. It is like a dictionary. He read every piece init, and copied into blank books, which he obtained for the purpose,everything he thought particularly interesting, especially all aboutarithmetic. Previously, he had studied navigation, or the methods wherebythe sailors are enabled to guide their ships across the ocean. In thisCyclopædia he found much upon this subject; also upon astronomy, or theknowledge of the stars and other heavenly bodies; and upon mensuration,or the art with which we are enabled to measure large quantities of landor water.[Sidenote: ALMANAC FOR 1790.]But he was not satisfied with merely studying what others did. He madeseveral dials and curious instruments for measuring the weather, &c. Helikewise, at the age of fourteen years, made an Almanac for 1790, soaccurately and minutely finished, that it might have been published.Whilst engaged upon this last, he was more than usually laborious. Thefirst rays of the morning saw him at labor, and he sat up, with hisrushlight, until late at night. If any asked where Nat was, the replywas, “He is engaged in making his Almanac.” He was just fourteen years ofage when he finished it.[2][Sidenote: BEGINS ALGEBRA.][Sidenote: HIS DELIGHT IN IT.]August 1, 1787,—that is, at the age of fourteen,—he was introduced to amode of calculating which was wholly new to him. His brother came homefrom his school, where he had been learning navigation, and told himthat his master had a mode of ciphering by means of letters. Nat puzzledhimself very much about the matter, and imagined a variety of methods of“ciphering with letters.” He thought that perhaps A added to B made C,and B added to C made D, and so on; but there seemed to him no use inall this. At length he begged his brother to obtain for him the book.The schoolmaster readily lent it; and it is said that the boy did notsleep that night. He was so delighted with reading about this method,or algebra, as it is called, that he found it impossible to sleep. Heafterwards talked with an old English sailor, who happened to knowsomething about the subject, and received some little instruction fromhim. This person afterwards went to his own country; but just before heleft Salem, he patted Nat upon the head, and said, “Nat, my boy, go onstudying as you do now, and you will be a great man one of these days.”You will see, before finishing this story, that the prophecy of the oldsailor was amply fulfilled.[Sidenote: DRS. PRINCE AND BENTLEY AID HIM.][Sidenote: DR. KIRWAN’S LIBRARY.][Sidenote: COPIES BOOKS.]But all this labor, this constant exertion, combined with his kind andcheerful disposition, must, you will readily believe, have given himfriends. He became known as a young man of great promise; as one morecapable than his elders of deciding many questions, particularly allthose in which any calculations were to be made. Consequently, when aboutseventeen or eighteen years old, he was often called upon, by men mucholder than himself, to act as umpire in important matters. All thesehe attended to so willingly and skilfully, that those whom he assistedbecame very much attached to him. He thus gained the respect not merelyof common persons, less learned than himself, but his industry, hisfidelity to his employers, his talents, attracted the notice of men wellknown in the community. Among these were two clergymen of Salem. Atthe church of Rev. Dr. Prince he attended for divine worship; and Dr.Bentley rarely passed the store without stepping in to talk with hisyoung friend. Nat availed himself of the learning of Dr. Bentley, andoften visited his room in order to converse with him. Dr. Prince, theother clergyman above alluded to, had studied much the subjects thatthe apprentice was pursuing, and he was very glad to see a young manzealous in the same pursuits. There was another individual who kept anapothecary’s shop; and it was he, who, with the aid of the two clergymen,opened to our young student the means of continuing his favorite studieswith more success than he had ever anticipated. Mr. Reed—for that was hisname—likewise gave him permission to use all his books, of which he hada great many. But the chief means of study, to which I allude, was thepermission to take books from a library which had been formed by a numberof gentlemen of the town. The kindness of the proprietors of this librarywas never forgotten by the young apprentice; and in his will, made fiftyyears afterwards, he left a thousand dollars to the Salem Athenæum, inorder to repay the debt of gratitude which he felt he had incurred. Butyou may want to know something about the formation of this library, andthe books of which it was composed. Some time during the RevolutionaryWar, alluded to in Chapter I., Dr. Kirwan, an Irishman and a learned man,put the greater part of his library on board a ship, in order to haveit carried across the Irish Channel. While on the voyage, the vesselwas taken by an American ship of war, and the books were carried intoBeverly, and were afterwards sold at auction in Salem. Of all in theworld, these books were perhaps those most needed by the apprentice. Hehad been studying those sciences chiefly, concerning which there werevery few works printed in America; and suddenly he found himself allowedfree access to all the important books which had been printed in Europeupon these same subjects. You may readily imagine how eagerly he availedhimself of the opportunity thus afforded him. Every two or three dayshe was seen with a number of volumes under his arm, going homeward; andon his arrival there, he read and _copied all_ he wanted to study atthat time, or refer to afterwards. He made, in this way, a very largecollection of manuscripts, which formed a part of his library. Thus, byhis own exertions, he, at the early age of eighteen, became acquaintedwith the writings of most of the learned men of Europe; and he did thisat the time when he was engaged almost constantly in his store, forhe made it a strict rule never to allow any study or reading, howeverinteresting, to interfere with his duties to his employers. He rarelyforgot this. The following incident impressed it so strongly upon hismemory, that it influenced all his subsequent life.[Sidenote: ATTENTION TO BUSINESS.]One day a customer called and purchased a pair of hinges at a time whenthe young clerk was deeply engaged in solving a problem in mathematics.He thought he would finish before charging the delivery of them upon thebooks; but when the problem was solved, he forgot the matter altogether.In a few days the customer called again to pay for them, when Mr. Hodgeshimself was in the shop. The books were examined, and gave no account ofthis purchase. The clerk, upon being applied to, at once recollected thecircumstance, and the reason of his own forgetfulness. From that day hemade it an invariable rule to finish every matter of business that hebegan, before undertaking anything else. Perhaps some of you may rememberthe story; and when you think of leaving anything half finished, you mayrepeat to yourselves, “Charge your hinges, and finish what you begin.”[Sidenote: STUDIES LATIN.]Having been instructed in the elements of algebra, Nat soon found thatthere were books written upon it in other languages, which he knewhe ought to read, if he intended to learn as much as he could aboutalgebra. One of these books was written in a tongue which is called adead language, in consequence of its having ceased to be spoken by thepeople of the country in which it was originally used. It was in Latin.This language usually requires many years of study, if one wishes to readit well, even when he has good instructors. Our hero, however, neverthought of the difficulties he had to surmount, but commenced, alone, thestudy of it, June, 1790, that is, when seventeen years old. He was soonin trouble. He could not understand his Latin book on mathematics. Heasked many who had been at college, but they were puzzled by the peculiarexpressions as much as he was. At length, however, by the aid of hisfriend Dr. Bentley, and afterwards of a German who gave him lessons, hesucceeded in mastering the greatest work in modern times, written bySir Isaac Newton, who, you know, was one of the most famous philosopherswho have ever lived in this world. Nat discovered in one part of ita mistake, which, several years afterwards, he published; but he wasdeterred from doing so at first, because a very much older person thanhe, a professor in Harvard College, said that the apprentice was mistaken.[Sidenote: STUDY OF FRENCH.][Sidenote: GOOD RESULTS.]But Latin was not the only language that he learned. Finding in theKirwan library many books upon mathematics written in French, hedetermined to learn that tongue likewise. Accordingly, at the age ofnineteen (May 15, 1792), he began to study it. Fortunately, he was ableto make an arrangement with a Frenchman living in Salem, who wishedto learn English. Mr. Jordy agreed to teach the apprentice French, oncondition that Nat would teach him English. For sixteen months they metregularly, a certain number of times a week; and the consequences werevery important to the youth’s future success in life. One circumstancetook place, during this study of French, which I think it important tomention. Nat, desiring only to learn to _read_ a French book, supposedthat it would be unnecessary to spend time in learning accurately to_pronounce_ the words. These, as is the case in the English tongue, areoften pronounced very differently from the manner in which we should beled to speak them, if we judged from their mode of spelling. His masterprotested against teaching without reference to the pronunciation; and,after much arguing, Nat yielded to the wishes of his instructor, andhe studied the language in such a way that he could converse with aFrenchman, as well as read a French book. You will soon see the good thatresulted.CHAPTER III._From 1784 to 1796—age, 10-22._    Apprenticeship continued.—Favorite of his companions.—Learns    music; neglects his studies for a time.—Gets into bad society;    his decision in freeing himself from it.—Engages in a survey    of the town of Salem.—Sails on his first voyage to the East    Indies; extracts from his Journal during this voyage; arrival    at the Isle of Bourbon; return home.[Sidenote: STUDY AND BUSINESS.][Sidenote: A GOOD COMPANION.]Though so interested in his studies, Nat tried, as we have seen, never toneglect a known duty. Whenever any one came to the store, he was readyto leave study in order to attend to him. And he did this cheerfully,and with so bright a smile that all were pleased to meet him. His youngcompanions loved him, for he was not one of those vain persons who thinkthemselves more important than others because they are more learned. Onthe contrary, what he knew himself he liked to impart to others. He wasa member of a juvenile club for the discussion of different subjects. Inthis association his opinion had much weight, because he rarely spoke,and never unless he had something of importance to say.[Sidenote: LOVE OF MUSIC.]Some of his comrades were very fond of music. He had originally a greattaste for it. Music, at that time, was less cultivated than it is now;and generally, those who practised it were fond of drinking liquor,and often became drunkards. Nat’s love of the flute led him, at times,to meet with several young men of this class. In fact, he was so muchdelighted with their company, that he began to forget his studies. Dayafter day he spent his leisure hours in their society; and, for a time,all else was neglected. At length he began to think somewhat in this way:“What am I doing? forgetting my studies in order to be with those whoseonly recommendation is, that they love music? I shall be very likely tofall into their habits if I continue longer with them. I will not doso.” He soon afterwards left their society.The simple, old-fashioned flute on which he played at these meetings isstill preserved. It is a silent monitor to his descendants, urging themto performance of duty, in spite of the allurements of pleasure.May every boy who reads this remember it, and try, if ever led intotemptation as the apprentice was, to say, “I will not,” with the samedetermined spirit that he did.The time was fast approaching when he was about to leave the businessof shopkeeping, and enter upon the more active duties of life. It istrue that, to a certain extent, he had been engaged in active life eversince entering his apprenticeship. At the age of ten he had left the homeof his mother, and had been obliged to depend much upon himself. Hisfather’s habits had finally prevented him from being of service to thefamily. The mother had died; the family had been broken up; and Nat hadthus, at an early age, been thrown upon the world. After having remainedwith Ropes & Hodges until they gave up business, he entered the shop ofSamuel C. Ward, which was a similar establishment; and there he remaineduntil he was twenty-one years old. He then quitted, forever, thisemployment.[Sidenote: SURVEY OF SALEM.]In 1794, by a law of the state, every town was obliged to have anaccurate survey and measurement made of its limits. Captain Gibaut andDr. Bentley were appointed by the Selectmen in Salem to superintend thisbusiness. Believing that the calculating powers of the apprentice wouldbe useful to them, he was made assistant; and during the summer of 1794he was occupied with this business. Thus we see how his studies alreadybegan to be useful to him. For his pay, he received one hundred andthirty-five dollars. Towards the end of the summer, Mr. Derby, a richship-owner in Salem, wished Captain Gibaut to take command of a vesselto Cadiz, and thence round the Cape of Good Hope to the East Indies.Captain Gibaut consented, and he asked Nat to go with him as clerk.Nat agreed to the terms; but, owing to some difficulty with Mr. Derby,Captain Gibaut resigned to Captain H. Prince. Young Bowditch was unknownto the latter; but at the suggestion of Mr. Derby, who had heard of thetalents and industry of the clerk, the same arrangements were continuedby Captain Prince.A new era in his life was now beginning; and let us look a moment at him.He is now twenty-one years of age. He is already more learned than manymuch older than himself, in consequence of his untiring industry and hisdevotion to study and to duty. Yet he is modest and retiring. He is stillfull of fun and frolic at times, and always ready for acts of kindness.Above all, he is a good youth; no immorality has stained him. His love oftruth had been given him by his mother; and since her death he has lovedit still more. It is to him a bright light, as it were, to guide him.Cannot we foresee his career?[Sidenote: FIRST VOYAGE TO INDIA.]On January 11, 1795,—that is, when he was a few months more thantwenty-one years of age,—he sailed from Salem in the ship Henry. Thoughhe went as clerk, he was prepared to undertake the more active dutiesof sailor and mate of the vessel. Thinking that he should be too muchoccupied to be able to read, he took very few books; and therefore hedevoted much more time to observations of the heavenly bodies, the stateof the weather, &c., while at sea, and upon the manners and habits of thenations he visited. Though he had not been educated as a sailor-boy, hisstudies had led him to understand the most important part of a seaman’slife, the art of guiding the vessel from one shore to another, acrossthe ocean. In other words, he had studied much on navigation, and copiedbooks upon that subject.[Sidenote: JOURNAL—MOTTO.]The Journal which he kept during the voyage is quite long. One of thefirst lines you meet, on opening the book, is the motto which he chosefor himself. It is in Latin, and means, that _he would do what he thoughtto be right, and not obey the dictates of any man_. He notes the eventsof every day, most of which are similar; but occasionally somethingunusual occurs.[Sidenote: SLAVERY.]February 7, 1795, he writes thus: “At ten A. M., spoke a ship,twenty-five days out, from Liverpool, bound to Africa. We discovered herthis morning, just before sunrise, and supposed her to be a frigate.”They discovered soon that it was a negro slave-ship, and he exclaimsthus: “God grant that the detestable traffic which she pursues may sooncease, and that the tawny sons of Africa may be permitted quietly toenjoy the blessings of liberty in their native land.”“February 22. We remember with gratitude that this is the anniversary ofthe birth of our beloved Washington—the man who unites all hearts. May helong continue a blessing to his country and to mankind at large!”During the passage to the Isle of Bourbon, situated, as you know, eastof the southern extremity of Africa, he frequently alludes to his nativeland in terms of respect and love. On May 8, the ship arrived in theharbor of Bourbon. Perhaps you may like to see his description of thetown.[Sidenote: BOURBON.]“May 9. After dinner, Captain P., Mr. B., and I, went to see the town.It is a fine place. All the streets run in straight lines from theshore, and cross one another at right angles. There is a church here,with a priest to officiate. I went into it. We afterwards went intothe republican garden. It is a beautiful place, though at present muchneglected. The different walks are made to meet in the centre, andform the figure of a star, each one of the rays of which is formed bythirty-four mango trees, placed from twelve to fourteen feet apart. Allthe houses of the island are built very low; they have no chimneys. Theyare two stories high (about ten feet), have lattice windows, outsideof which are wooden ones to keep off the sun and rain. The floors aremade of the wood of the country, on which they rub wax, as the women ofAmerica do on their furniture. It makes them very slippery.” There areother places of which he speaks, and in them he finds flower-gardens inabundance, intermixed with groves of coffee and orange trees, &c.He afterwards alludes to the poor slaves, who, it appeared, suffered asmuch there as they do in some other places at the present day.[Sidenote: HABITS THERE.]He visits the people of the place, and finds them superstitious andvicious. Alluding to the vice he found there, he writes, “I was remindedof the beautiful words of Solomon, in the Proverbs.” This was not theonly occasion on which he remembered his Bible; and it seemed always tohave a kindly influence over him. On one occasion, several young menargued with him about its truth; and, having heard them patiently, he puthis hand over his heart: “Talk no more about it. I know that the Bible istrue; that it is capable of doing to me the greatest good. I know so bythe feelings I have here.”After remaining in this place until July 25, he set sail for home, andarrived in Salem January 11, 1796, having been absent exactly twelvemonths.CHAPTER IV._From 1796 to 1797—age, 23-4._    Second voyage.—Visits Lisbon.—Island of Madeira; festival and    games there.—Anecdotes of his skill as an accountant.—Doubles    Cape of Good Hope.—Albatrosses.—Arrival at Manilla.—Extracts    from Journal.—Curious boat.—Earthquake.—Voyage home.[Sidenote: AT SEA AGAIN.][Sidenote: SECOND VOYAGE.]After remaining at home about two months, he again sailed in the sameship, and with Captain Prince. On the 26th of the following March, theyprepared to sail from Salem harbor; but, being prevented by contrarywinds from getting out of the bay, the anchor was dropped during thenight, and on the following morning, under fair but strong breezes,Mr. Bowditch was again on his way across the wide Atlantic. His coursewas towards Lisbon, situated at the mouth of the River Tagus, inPortugal. The first part of the voyage was unpleasant, because cloudyand stormy weather prevailed most of the time; but during the latterpart, under pleasant and mild breezes from the south, the ship rode gaylyonwards, and, on the morning of April 24, the vessel was within sightof Lisbon, with its beautiful and romantic country behind it. Lisbon isthe chief city of Portugal, and presents a very superb appearance whenviewed from a vessel which is entering the harbor. It is the principalcommercial place in the kingdom. Its inhabitants are among the richest.In consequence of its being the place of residence of the kings ofPortugal, many magnificent country-seats, or villas, are seen on all thevine-covered hills of the adjacent country.The stay at this city was short, and the opportunities for visitingthe interesting places in it very limited. Mr. Bowditch seems not tohave been particularly pleased with its appearance. At the time he wasthere, probably, much less attention was paid to the cleanliness of thestreets than there is now. But he spent the 28th and 29th of April inwalking about the city, and says in his Journal, that he “found nothingremarkable.”[Sidenote: LISBON, INCIDENT.]It was at Lisbon that Mr. Bowditch discovered the advantage of havinglearned to _speak_ French, to which I alluded at the close of the secondchapter. Though a Portuguese port, the custom-house officers understoodFrench; and no one on board but he could speak any other languagethan the English. The consequence was, that he acted as interpreter,which was, of course, a great help to the captain. This incident madea deep impression upon his mind; and in after-life, when a person inconversation expressed a doubt about the importance of any kind ofknowledge, because for the time it seemed useless, he would reply, “O,study everything, and your learning will, some time or other, be ofservice. I once said that I would not learn to _speak_ French, because Ithought that I should never leave my native town; yet, within a few yearsafterwards, I was in a foreign port, and I became sole interpreter ofthe ship’s crew, in consequence of my power to speak this language.”[Sidenote: MADEIRA.][Sidenote: GAMES.]On the 30th, having taken on board a quantity of wine, they again wereready for sea; but, owing to bad weather, they did not sail until the 6thof May, when the ship dropped down the river. On the 6th it was on itsway to the Island of Madeira, which is a small island, situated aboutthree hundred and sixty miles from the northern part of Africa. At eleveno’clock, May 15, the island was discovered; and, under full sail, theship swept along the shore until nine in the evening, when they haileda pilot, who came on board, from the town of Funchal. Mr. Pintard, theAmerican consul of the place, greeted them very cordially. The ship spentsix days there, taking in more wine,—for which the country is famous,—andsailed from it on Thursday morning, May 26, 1796. During this residenceat Mr. Pintard’s, Mr. Bowditch saw some feats of horsemanship, aboutwhich you may like to hear. They are thus described in his Journal: “Aring being suspended by a small wire, about ten feet from the ground, atthe entrance of the gate of the public garden, a horseman attempted tostrike it, and carry it off, while upon full gallop. If he gained theprize, he was attended by the master of ceremonies, mounted on a smallcolt fantastically adorned with ribbons, &c., with a most deformed mask,who generally gave him a reward fully proportioned to the merit of theaction; perhaps a whistle, a small flower, or some little image. Duringthe next day, no business was done by the inhabitants; but the whole ofit was devoted to amusements similar to those of the preceding. Againthere were masquerades, and some of the richest men in the place joinedwith the crowd, masked like the people. Others were very richly dressed,like Turks, East Indians, &c. One of them wore a head-dress worth, it wassaid, forty or fifty thousand dollars.” From this description, slight asit is, we may see the difference in the customs between these inhabitantsof Madeira and the Americans.[Sidenote: ANECDOTE.]Captain Prince relates the following anecdotes, which occurred duringtheir residence at Madeira. I shall use Captain Prince’s words.“I was one day walking with an American shipmaster at Madeira, who, inthe course of conversation, asked me who that young man (alluding to Mr.Bowditch) was. I replied, that he was clerk of the ship under my command,and remarked that he was a great calculator. ‘Well,’ said the gentleman,‘I can set him a sum that he can’t do.’ I answered that I did not believeit. The gentleman then proposed a wager of a dinner to all the Americanmasters in port, that he could set him such a sum. The wager was acceptedby me, and we repaired to the hotel, where we found Mr. B. alone. Thegentleman was introduced, and the question stated to Mr. Bowditch, withthe interrogatory, Can you do it? The reply was, Yes. The great sum whichhad puzzled the brains of the gentleman and all his friends at home, fora whole winter, was done in a few minutes. I remember the question. Itwas this: To dig a ditch around an acre of land, how deep and how widemust that ditch be, to raise the acre of land one foot?[Sidenote: KNOWLEDGE OF NAVIGATION.]“One day, Mr. Bowditch and myself received a visit from a Mr. Murray,a Scotchman, who was at that port, having under his charge a valuablecargo of English goods, and who made many inquiries concerning theAmericans. He asked particularly what passage we had made against thenorth-east monsoon, and remarked that it was very surprising that theAmericans should come so far, and undertake such difficult voyages, withso little knowledge as they possessed of the science of navigation. Inreply to his remark, I told him that I had on board twelve men, all ofwhom were as well acquainted with working lunar observations for all thepractical purposes of navigation, as Sir Isaac Newton would be, shouldhe come on earth. Mr. M. asked how my crew came by that knowledge. Itold him, in the same manner that other men came by theirs. He thoughtit so wonderful, that (as he afterwards told me) he went down to thelanding-place, on Sunday, to see my _knowing_ crew come on shore. Duringall this conversation, Mr. Bowditch remained silent, sitting with hisslate pencil in his mouth, and as modest as a maid. Mr. Kean, a broker,who was also present, observed to Murray, ‘Sir, if you knew what I knowconcerning that ship, you would not talk quite so fast.’ ‘And what doyou know?’ asked Murray. ‘I know,’ replied Kean, ‘that there is moreknowledge of navigation on board that American ship (the Astræa) thanthere has been in all the ships that ever came into Manilla Bay.’”[Sidenote: TEACHES THE SAILORS.]Mr. Bowditch, during this and the previous voyage, had been in the habitof teaching navigation to the sailors; so that it is probable that,considering the number of persons then on board who really understoodpractical navigation, Mr. Kean was not so extravagant in his remark as atfirst sight he seems to be.[Sidenote: LUNAR RAINBOW.]May 26, as we have already said, he sailed for India. On July 1, theIsland of Trinidad was within sight. They did not stop there, butkeeping on their course steadily, two days afterwards crossed theTropic of Capricorn, in the Southern Hemisphere. On the 17th, duringthe night, it having rained during the day, the young sailor observed,what we rarely see in this part of the world and on land, but which isnot uncommon at sea, a beautiful lunar rainbow. It is caused in the samemanner as those rainbows which are seen after a summer shower in thedaytime, when the sun is just coming out brightly, and the clouds, whichcause the bow to be formed, are passing away afar off in the oppositepart of the heavens. But the difference between the solar and lunarrainbows is very great. The solar is grander and has more brilliantcoloring, while the lunar bow has a more delicate outline and lightertints.August 1, the Journal says, “All the latter part of these twenty-fourhours, fine breezes and pleasant, smooth sea. Ever since crossing theCape [of Good Hope], we have seen a great number of albatrosses, but nofish.” These birds are the largest of marine birds. They at times flyand swim (for they are web-footed) to a great distance from land, livingupon the fish and other things which may fall in their way. It is saidthat, as they come gently rising over the waves of the sea, they presenta very pleasing sight to the sailor who has been for many months upon theocean, separated from living things.[Sidenote: PHOSPHORESCENT LIGHT.]For some weeks afterwards, the ship met with severe weather, untilSeptember 7, when, according to previous expectation, they saw the landof the Island of Java. The day before their arrival at that place, acurious phenomenon was observed, the account of which I will copy fromthe Journal. “At seven P. M., the water, as for the two nights past,became of a perfect milk color, through the whole extent of the horizon.We drew a bucket of it in order to determine whether there was anythingin it to account for the curious phenomenon. When seen by candlelight,nothing could be observed; but, when carried into a dark place, itappeared full of small, bright, cylindric substances, of the nature of ajelly, about the size of a small wire, and a quarter of an inch long.Some large jellies floated on the water at the same time, and lookedlike long pieces of wood. The sky all this time was perfectly clear; nota cloud to be seen. About three A. M. the water began to take its usualcolor. Next morning we examined the water which had appeared so shiningin the night; but nothing could be discovered in it, although it wasviewed in a very dark place. In the forenoon the sea appeared somewhatcolored, of a greenish hue; but some of it, being taken up and carriedfrom the light, appeared colorless.”[Sidenote: ISLAND OF JAVA.][Sidenote: ARRIVAL AT MANILLA.]The next morning the high lands of the Island of Java came in sight onthe horizon, at the distance of about twenty miles towards the east.The Journal kept during his passage through the Straits of Sunda isinteresting, because the greatest care was necessary to keep the shipoff from the shoals which abound there. The current runs at times veryswiftly, the strait being between the large islands of Sumatra andJava, and on the 9th, the force of this current, and strong headwinds,compelled the captain to cast anchor two or three times. Finally, on the17th, the ship was fairly out of the Straits of Sunda and Straits ofBanca, having been ten days, during sultry weather, toiling, with muchdanger, amid coral reefs and shoals. The remainder of the voyage along bythe coast of Borneo to the city of Manilla, the capital of the chief ofthe Philippine Islands, was more speedy. At six in the morning of Sunday,October 2, 1796, the Island of Luzon was in sight towards the east, abouteighteen miles off. That same evening they cast anchor in Manilla Bay, itbeing a little more than six months since the sailor had left his home inSalem.[Sidenote: COSTUMES OF THE PEOPLE.]The following are some extracts from his Journal while in the city.Under date of October 4, he says, “No coffee can be procured here; theSpaniards, not being very fond of it, cultivate the cocoa instead. Thecommon drink of the natives is sweetmeats and water, which beverage, theysay, is wholesome and agreeable. Large quantities of wax are producedhere; but it is very dear, owing to the great consumption of it in thechurches, of which there are a great number in Manilla and its environs.There are a few bishops in the island, and one archbishop, whose power isvery great. The priests are very powerful, every native wearing the imageof the Virgin Mary, a cross, or some such thing. No books are allowedto be imported contrary to their religion. The commandant who makes thevisit examines every vessel.... The inhabitants of the city and suburbsare very numerous, amounting to nearly three hundred thousand. In thePhilippines there are about two or three millions. A great number areChinese; and in general they are a well-made people. Their common dressis a shirt, and trousers, or jackets and trousers. The women have greatnumbers of handkerchiefs about them, so as to be entirely covered. Thenatives are well used by the Spaniards, the King of Spain, in all hispublic papers, calling them his children.” From these extracts you mayjudge of Mr. Bowditch’s mode of studying a people when residing withstrangers. He afterwards speaks of their games, &c.[Sidenote: SINGULAR BOAT.]The following description of a boat appears on record of October 5: “Attwelve, set sail for Cavite in one of the passage-boats, which is veryinconvenient for passengers; being nearly three hours before arrivingat Cavite, during which time I was basking in the sun. Their boats andmanner of sailing are very curious. Having generally light winds, theymake their mat sails very large, and the boats, made of the bodies oftrees, are very long and narrow; so that there would be great danger ofupsetting, if it were not for “out-riggers,” which they have on eachside, consisting of two bamboos about eight or ten feet long, whoseends are joined to another long bamboo, running lengthwise of the boat.The lee one, on a flaw of wind, sinks a little in the water, and, beingbuoyant, keeps the boats from upsetting; and on the weather [that is,towards the wind] ones the persons in the boat are continually going outand in, according to the force of the breeze. In a fresh breeze therewill be six or eight men at the end of the bamboo, there being ropesleading from the top of the mast to different parts of the bamboo, tosupport them as they go. By this means they keep the boat always upright,and make it sail very fast, in a good breeze going five or six knots.”After this, a good account is given of the mode of counting used by theMalays.[Sidenote: EARTHQUAKE.]“November 5. About two P. M. there came on, without any preceding noise,a very violent shock of an earthquake. It commenced towards the north,and ran very nearly in a southerly direction. It continued nearly twominutes; everything appeared in motion. When it happened, the captain andmyself were sitting reading, and we immediately ran out of the house.All the natives were down on their knees, in the middle of the streets,praying and crossing themselves. It was the most violent earthquake knownfor a number of years. It threw down a large house about half a leaguefrom the city, untiled one of their churches, and did considerabledamage to the houses about the city and its suburbs. Nothing of it wasfelt on board the shipping.”[Sidenote: HOME AGAIN.]On Monday, December 12, having sold their wines and laden their vesselwith sugar, indigo, pepper, and hides, the party set sail from Manilla,heartily tired with the vices and superstitions of the place. Retracingtheir course through the Straits of Sunda, with much difficulty theyregained the Indian Ocean, and then, setting full sail, they once morelooked towards home.In coming round the Cape of Good Hope, the wind was very favorable.During their passage, several ships were met with, all of whom told themof home, and of the beginning of troubles between America and France, andEngland. Finally, at six A. M., they saw Cape Ann towards the north-west,and at two P. M., May 22, 1797, the vessel was riding at anchor in Salemharbor, having been about half round the world, and nearly fourteenmonths from Salem.CHAPTER V._From 1797 to 1800—age, 24-7._    Marriage.—Third voyage; visits Spain.—Dangers.—Earl    St. Vincent’s fleet.—Arrival at Cadiz.—Observatory at    Cadiz.—Sails for Alicant.—Passage through the Straits of    Gibraltar.—Privateers; chased by one; anecdotes of Mr. B.’s    love of study shown then.—Hears news of the death of his wife;    consoles himself with mathematical studies.—More troubles with    privateers.—Leaves Alicant.—Advantages derived from his visit    to Spain.—Fourth voyage; to India.—Extracts from Journal on    viewing a ship that was engaged in the slave trade.—Arrival    at Java; introduction to the governor; respect formerly paid    to him.—Anecdote of English navy officers.—Goes to Batavia    and Manilla.—Observations of Jupiter while becalmed near the    Celebean Islands.—Voyage home.[Sidenote: TRADES FOR HIMSELF.][Sidenote: FIRST MARRIAGE.]During these two voyages, Mr. Bowditch had been engaged in trade forhimself; and having thereby gained a little property, he wished to remainat home and enjoy the blessings of domestic life, from which he hadbeen separated at the age of ten years, when he left the abode of hisparents. In accordance with this wish, on the 25th day of March, 1798,he married an excellent and intelligent woman, named Elizabeth Boardman.But in a few months he was again called to a seafaring life. His youngand beautiful wife was already beginning to show symptoms of that diseasewhich eventually removed her from her husband and friends. It was a hardstruggle for the tenderly attached couple to separate; but duty calledthe husband, and obedience to duty was always his watchword. Accordingly,by August 15, 1798, he was prepared for sea, in the same ship, withthe same owner, Captain Derby, and his friend Captain Prince. On thisoccasion he went as joint supercargo. It was on the 21st of August—nearlyfive months from the date of his marriage—that he bade adieu to his wife.He never saw her again. Full of devotedness to him, she, however, urgedhim to do what he thought right, unconscious that she should never moreembrace him. During his absence she died at the age of eighteen years.[Sidenote: VOYAGE TO SPAIN.]One of the objects of the present voyage was to go to Cadiz, the chiefsouthern port in Spain. It was rather dangerous at this time for anyvessel to sail towards Europe, as the revolution in France had takenplace only a short time before, and most of the nations of Europe werebeginning to rise against that country; but as Spain was united withFrance, an English fleet was hovering about the Straits of Gibraltar. Theconsequence was, that it was of great importance to avoid all vessels,for fear of meeting a privateer.On the 19th of September, after nearly a month’s voyage, they came withinsight of the shores of Spain; and at seven A. M. the next day, theydiscovered the English fleet, under command of Earl St. Vincent, severalleagues to the eastward of them. On this same day they were boarded bythe captain of an American vessel, who informed them that the privateerswere very numerous in the straits.[Sidenote: CADIZ.]By Mr. Bowditch’s Journal we learn the following:—“On Thursday afternoon, 20th of September, the winds continued lightand variable to the westward. Captain Prince steered directly for EarlSt. Vincent’s fleet, and at two P. M. the Hector, of seventy-four guns,Captain Camel, sent his lieutenant on board, ordering us to bear down tohim. Captain Prince went aboard, was treated politely, and received apassport to enter Cadiz.” On the 21st, at four P. M., anchor was cast inthat harbor.The state in which poor Spain was at this time was miserable enough.There was but one newspaper in the whole kingdom, and that was printed atMadrid. Everything was degraded about that once noble and brave-heartedpeople. Upon the appearance of Cadiz the Journal says thus: “The streetsof the city, although narrow, are very neatly paved, and swept every day,so that they are very clean. They have broad, flat stones at the sides.All the houses are of stone, with roofs but little sloping. There arefortifications all around the city.”[Sidenote: BATTLE OF THE NILE.]“September 29, 1798. This day news came of the destruction of theFrench fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, by Lord Nelson.”[3] Of thisevent you will read in history at some future time; but it was deemedvery important at that time by the whole world. It was one of the mostformidable checks received by the French after they had begun to overrunEurope.This news, of course, was very interesting to our voyager; but, althoughexcited by the political and military contests of the day, he did notforget the subject to which, from earliest years, he had devoted himself.You will perceive from the following extracts from his Journal, thathe now was studying astronomy. In fact, he had been reading, duringhis previous voyages, many of the greatest works on mathematics andastronomy.[Sidenote: OBSERVATORY AT CADIZ.]“November 12. During our residence in Cadiz we formed an acquaintancewith Count Mallevante, who, before the revolution, commanded a Frenchfrigate at Martinico, and at present is a post-captain in the Spanishnavy. He carried us to the New Observatory, built on the Island of Cadiz,where we were shown all the instruments they had mounted. There were notany of them very new. The person who went with us was named Cosmo deChurruca. I promised to send him, on my arrival in America, the worksof Dr. Holyoke on Meteorology. I gave him my method of working a lunarobservation, which he was to print at the end of the Nautical Almanac.”[Sidenote: FRENCH PRIVATEERS.]“At half past four P. M., got under way, and beat out of the harbor ofCadiz, in company with three other American vessels, which sailed underthe protection of the Astræa.” They were destined for Alicante, andconsequently their course lay through the Straits of Gibraltar, up alongthe south-eastern coast of Spain. On the afternoon of the 14th, they fellin again with the English fleet, which, with those under their convoy,consisted of forty-five vessels. As the fleet was steering in the samedirection, they kept company with it, being all bound for the Straits ofGibraltar. Next day they saw another convoy of twenty vessels, and twoof those accompanying the Astræa joined it. The Astræa was obliged tofall behind, because the remaining vessel under its protection sailed tooslowly. On the 18th the whole convoy entered the Straits, except one,which was chased by French privateers, ten of which could be counted infull view; but, on the approach of the Astræa, the enemy retreated.[Sidenote: FEARLESSNESS.][Sidenote: DANGERS FROM PIRATES.]The moon was shining brightly on the night of the 19th of November, 1799.Many times had the bell broken over the silent sea from the ship’s deck,telling of the passing hours, when suddenly the crew of the Astræa wascalled to quarters, for a suspicious sail was seen bearing down towardsthem. The cannon, of which nineteen were on board, were all clearedfor action, and every sailor, placed at his post, watched anxiously asthe privateer came rapidly towards them. Captain Prince assigned toMr. Bowditch a station in the cabin, through which the powder was tobe passed to the deck. When all on deck was ready, and that deep andsolemn silence which always comes over every part of a ship that isjust approaching the enemy, was beginning to creep over those on boardthe Astræa, the captain stepped for a moment into the cabin to see ifeverything was in order; and “there sat Mr. Bowditch at the cabin table,with his slate and pencil in hand, and with the cartridges lying byhis side.” Entirely absorbed with his problem, he forgot all danger,thus showing that his love of science, even when in imminent peril,was superior to all feelings of fear. This anecdote, doubtless, willamuse you. It reminds me of the geometrician Archimedes, who lived twohundred years before Christ, who, as some of you may know, was slain bythe soldiers of the Roman General Marcellus, when they sacked the cityof Syracuse. Archimedes had labored much for his countrymen during thesiege, but finally, it is said, became so engaged in his studies thathe did not know that the soldiers had taken possession of the town untilthey attacked and killed him. Fortunately, in the case of Mr. Bowditch,no evil ensued. Captain Prince could not restrain himself, but burst intoa loud laugh, and asked Mr. Bowditch whether he could make his will atthat moment; to which question Mr. Bowditch answered, with a smile, inthe affirmative. Captain Prince adds, “But on all occasions of danger hemanifested great firmness, and, after the affair of the privateer (which,by the by, did not molest us), he requested to be stationed at one of theguns, which request was granted him.”[Sidenote: SORROW RELIEVED BY STUDY.]In this way they continued cruising along the beautiful Mediterranean,but perpetually exposed to danger. Now they come within sight of the highlands of Malaga, and shortly they fly away from some pirate on the broadsea. Now they are quietly sailing along under the warm and sunny skiesof an Andalusian climate, and again, in the course of a few hours, aredriven by the current and tempest far away to the south-west. Finally,after a tedious passage, the ship was moored, on Friday evening, November23, in the harbor of Alicante. After considerable difficulty and delaybecause the city authorities were afraid of disease being brought intothe place by the crews of the ships, they were at length allowed to goon shore. Here melancholy tidings awaited our voyager. By a Salem vesselthat had arrived at Cadiz, news came of the death of his wife some timein the preceding October. He made no complaints, however, but quietlysought to interest his mind in his favorite pursuit of astronomy. Healways did so whenever any trouble came upon him. In this way he consoledhimself, and was not a burden to others by allowing his sorrows todisturb them.[Sidenote: INSOLENCE OF PRIVATEERS.]January 24, 1799, having finished loading the ship with brandy, theywould have sailed, had not the wind prevented. On February 11th they werestill detained by head winds; but now, to their discomfort, they saw aFrench privateer cruising off in the bay at the mouth of the harbor. Itwas evidently waiting to intrap some one of the American vessels. On thenext day the daring of the privateer commander arose to such a height,that he rowed in his barge all around the American fleet, and insultedsome of the seamen. Towards evening of February 13, Mr. Bowditch narrowlyescaped serious difficulty with them, as the privateer barge and theAmerican boat coming from shore came in contact; but the former receivedthe most damage, and Mr. Bowditch got safely on board the Astræa. Onthe 14th, the brigand of the sea departed, and his ship was soon seengradually losing itself in the distance over the blue Mediterranean.[Sidenote: TO INDIA.]On the next day the convoy sailed. It consisted of five vessels, and bytwenty-four hours of favorable breezes they were brought within thirtymiles of the coast of Barbary; and, after some trouble in consequenceof being obliged to take in tow those of the convoy which sailed moreslowly, the Astræa was fairly out from the Straits of Gibraltar byFebruary 24, that is, three days from the time of leaving Alicante.During half the passage home, some of the convoy were in company withthem. They had rough seas; but on the 6th of April, at ten o’clock atnight, Mr. Bowditch arrived in Salem harbor, having been absent nearlynine months.This visit to Spain was of service to him in many respects. He thereobtained many books on astronomy and navigation, and some celebratedworks on history, all of which he studied with care on his voyage home.He, moreover, had gained some knowledge by his visit to the Observatory.[Sidenote: STUDIES DURING THE VOYAGE.]He was not destined to remain at home a long while; but the Astræa havingbeen sold to a merchant in Boston, Mr. Bowditch sailed with CaptainPrince from that city on the 23d of the following July, bound for India.It was a long, and to most persons a tedious voyage that he was about toundertake; but to Mr. Bowditch it was the means of improvement. Whilethe ship was sailing quietly along, or sinking lazily from one swell ofthe sea to another, or being tossed about by the most violent gale, Mr.Bowditch was still laboring at his books. During this voyage, as duringthe preceding, he did not perform much duty, except when in port, and,consequently, on board ship he had a great deal of time to be devotedto study. And he worthily filled every moment with reading and studyto improve himself or others. During this voyage, as in previous ones,he taught the sailors practical navigation. Very few incidents worthmentioning occurred during the voyage; but on the 15th of September,1799, we find the following in his Journal: “The ship in sight yesterdaysoon proved to be an English Guineaman. As we came up with him he fireda gun to leeward, which we returned. As we came nearer, he fired one towindward. We returned the compliment and nearly hulled him. When withinhail, he ordered our boat out, which Captain Prince refused, telling himto come on board if he wanted anything. Finally, he requested CaptainPrince to haul out our boat, as his was calking, which we could plainlysee. Mr. Carlton went on board with the clearance, and the surgeon cameaboard of us, and, after examining our papers and acting in a mannerbecoming a Guineaman, they made sail.”[Sidenote: SLAVE SHIP FROM GUINEA.][Sidenote: ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.]In order to understand this allusion to the Guineaman, you shouldknow that, at the time we are reading of, the greater part of Englishmerchants, especially those of Liverpool, were engaged in the horridtraffic called the Slave Trade. Immense numbers of vessels were annuallysent from Liverpool and other places in England for the sole purpose ofsailing to the coast of Africa, there to get a cargo of the poor natives,whom they carried to the West Indian Islands and America, in order thatthey might be sold, as slaves, into perpetual bondage. Men, women, andchildren, were taken indiscriminately, and crammed together, like balesof cotton or any other goods, between the decks of the vessels. You mayimagine that those who could engage in such abominable proceedings musthave lost all the feelings of humanity. They were used to blood andrapine; hence you can understand the reason why Mr. Bowditch uses theterm of reproach that he does. I thank Heaven—and I feel sure you willagree with me—that, by the efforts of devoted men and women in Englandand elsewhere, that trade has been formally abolished by Great Britain,and that every man who now sets his foot on British soil becomes free.Thank God, also, that our late civil war has destroyed every vestige ofAmerican slavery, and that we can claim, that no slave can now breathe onthe soil of England or America. But to return to the Astræa.[Sidenote: BATAVIA.]On December 17 they arrived at Batavia, the chief city of the Island ofJava. The following will give you some idea of the place and persons init:—“Upon our arrival, after making our report to the custom-house, weproceeded to the Saabandar, who introduced us to the governor and thegovernor-general, who is commander-in-chief, and formerly lived inall the splendor of an Asiatic monarch. At present the outward marksof respect are far less than they were twenty or thirty years ago. Informer times he was attended by his guards, preceded by two trumpeters.Every carriage was forced to stop, and the persons within obliged todismount, under the penalty of one hundred ducatoons (about one hundredand sixty-seven dollars). Captain —— refused even to stop his carriage,and forced his coachman to drive on. The officers of an English squadronlying at Batavia, in order to show their contempt of the procession,formed a party similar to that attending the governor, only, insteadof the aids with their staves, one of the officers bore a staff with acow’s horn tipped with gold, and another an empty bottle. The rest of theofficers of the fleet met this procession, and made their respects toit, as the natives did to the governor. At present, all these practicesare brought into contempt, so that none now stop for any officers ofgovernment.”[Sidenote: THE PLANET JUPITER.]The Astræa remained but four days at Batavia, the captain finding thathe could not fill his vessel with coffee, as he intended. Consequently,after taking a fresh supply of provisions and of water, they weighedanchor, and bore towards the north, with the intention of visitingManilla, as on his second voyage. Traversing the Straits of Macassar,they passed slowly up through the China Sea, and anchored in Manilla Bayon the 14th of February, 1800. During this passage we find Mr. Bowditchstill occupied in the study of science. When floating, becalmed, amongthe islands, during the quiet night, he is observing the appearance ofthe planet Jupiter, and studying the motions of its beautiful satellites.As he was thus occupied, he thought of the immense power of that Beingwho first put the bright planet in its appropriate place, and caused itto revolve around our sun, while its own little satellites, like fourmoons, were to keep it company, silently and grandly, in its mysteriouscourse.[Sidenote: DEATH OF WASHINGTON.]After remaining at Manilla long enough to get a cargo, the ship wasprepared for home. On the 23d of March it sailed, and during a passageof six months very little occurred to interrupt Mr. Bowditch’s dailylabors. It arrived on the 16th of September, 1800. About a fortnightbefore this,—September 2, a ship was observed to windward, which boredown upon them. By the captain they were informed of the melancholynews (as Mr. Bowditch says in his Journal) “of the death of our belovedWashington. Thus,” continues he, “has finished the career of thatillustrious man, that great general, that consummate statesman, thatelegant writer, that real patriot, that friend to his country and to allmankind!”During these different voyages Mr. Bowditch gained more property. Havingobtained, likewise, what was much better, a reputation, among hisfellow-citizens, as a man of great learning, perseverance, extraordinaryskill in the transaction of business, and unyielding uprightness, hedetermined to remain at home. He therefore bade farewell to the sailor’slife, as he supposed, forever.CHAPTER VI._From 1800 to 1803—age, 27-30._    Second marriage; character of his wife.—Mr. Bowditch engages    in commerce for two years.—School committee.—East India    Marine Society; a description of the annual meeting of this    society.—Mr. Bowditch becomes part owner of ship Putnam, and    sails for India.—Anecdote, occurrence a few days after leaving    Salem.—Studies during the long voyage.—Begins to study and make    notes upon La Place’s “Mécanique Céleste.”—Arrival off Sumatra;    difficulties there.—Boarded by English man-of-war.—Revisits    Isle of France.—Journal extracts about modes of procuring    pepper; seasons for it, &c.—Incident on approaching Salem    harbor.—Decision of Mr. Bowditch.[Sidenote: SECOND MARRIAGE.][Sidenote: CHARACTER OF HIS WIFE.]On the 28th of October, 1800, Mr. Bowditch married his cousin, MaryIngersoll. She was destined to live with him thirty-four years, andwas the source of much of his happiness in life. She was a person insome respects as remarkable as her husband. She was possessed ofexcellent judgment, unwearying kindness and love. She had also an elasticcheerfulness which scarcely anything could subdue, and very strongreligious feelings. She was constantly trying to aid him. Instead ofseeking for enjoyment in display, she preferred economical retirement,and great but respectable frugality, in order that her husband mightpursue more thoroughly and easily his favorite studies, and mightpurchase books of science. Instead of collecting beautiful furniture, shecalled her visitors to see the new works of learning that her husbandhad imported from foreign lands. Yet, with all this devoted love, withall this reverence for his talents and virtues, she remained his truefriend, and never shrunk from fully expressing her own opinion upon everymatter of duty; and if, perchance, she differed from him, she maintainedher side of the question with the zeal of a saint. It has been oftensaid, that, had Mr. Bowditch been united with a woman of a differenttemperament, he would have been an entirely different person. He lovedstudy, it was true; but none enjoyed more than he the delights of afamily circle. None needed more than he did the kindness of a wife andchildren. She lived with him thirty-four years, and on the 17th of April,1834, she died of consumption, after long and severe suffering.[Sidenote: REPUTATION AT HOME.][Sidenote: EAST INDIA MARINE SOCIETY.]But I am anticipating my story. For two years after his arrival from hislast voyage, Mr. Bowditch remained at home, and engaged as a merchantin commerce. We find him generally, in connection with his old friendCaptain Prince, trying his fortunes by adventures of money sent todifferent parts of the world. In 1802 he owned one sixth of a smallschooner and its cargo, valued at nine hundred and eleven dollars. Duringthis long residence in town, his fame had increased. He had becomeknown among his fellow-citizens as an “able mathematician.”[4] He wastherefore appointed to offices of honor and trust. He was a member ofthe school committee of the town. This boy, who had been obliged toleave school at the age of ten years and three months, was now, at theage of twenty-five years, appointed to superintend the instruction ofothers. He was secretary of the East India Marine Society of Salem.This society had one of the most interesting collections of East Indiancuriosities that can be found in America. It is now in the possessionof the Essex Institute. The East India Marine Society was composed ofthe most influential men in Salem. No one could be enrolled among theirnumber unless he had sailed, as captain or supercargo of a vessel,around either Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope. It was intended as abenevolent society, for the relief of the families of deceased members,and also for the promotion of the art of navigation. Mr. Bowditch wasone of its most active members. In the early part of this century, thesociety was accustomed, on the days of its annual meeting, to have apublic procession. A description of one of these processions may notbe uninteresting to you. I quote the words of an eye-witness[5] of acelebration that occurred two years later than the period of which I amspeaking; but the date is unimportant, as the ceremony was the same.“January 4, 1804. This day was the annual meeting of the East IndiaMarine Society. As the clergy attend in turn, this occasion afforded mean opportunity to enjoy the day with them. After business, but beforedinner, they moved in procession, but the ice limited the distance.Each of the brethren bore some Indian curiosity, and the palanquin wasborne by negroes dressed nearly in the Indian manner. A person dressedin Chinese habits, and masked, passed in front. The crowd of spectatorswas great. Several gentlemen were invited to dine. Instrumental musicwas provided in the town, for the first time, and consisted of a bassdrum, bassoon, clarinet, and flute (!), and was very acceptable. Therewas no singing.” ... “It is a most happy arrangement,” continues thiswriter, “to deliver all the papers of this company into the hands of Mr.Nathaniel Bowditch, lately returned from his voyage to India, that theymay be prepared for public inspection.”In July, 1802, Mr. Bowditch bought a part of a small vessel engaged in asealing voyage; but he lost, by this adventure, half of his investment.In September of the same year, he, with three others, bought the new shipPutnam, built a short time previously, at Danvers. This purchase probablycaused a change in his determination of never going to sea again.[Sidenote: SAILS HIS LAST VOYAGE.][Sidenote: ANECDOTE.][Sidenote: STUDIES MÉCANIQUE CÉLESTE.]On the 21st of November he sailed as master, and owner of one smallpart of the whole ship and cargo, valued at fifty-six thousand dollars.Though he went in the capacity of captain, he was determined to donothing more than direct the course of the ship. He meant to leave tothe officers under him all the labor usually expected of commanders. Hemade an agreement with two skilful persons to take upon themselves theseduties. He did so in order that he might be able to pursue his studiesmore uninterruptedly than would have been possible, had he been obligedto watch every favorable breeze, or the first appearance of a gatheringstorm. But, as we shall see, whenever real danger called him to duty, hethen stood firm, and gave his commands like one who was satisfied thatthe time had come for him to do so. A few days after leaving the port ofBeverly, he was seen walking “fore and aft” the vessel, with rapid steps,and deeply absorbed, apparently, in the solution of a problem. The windhad been blowing freshly for some time; and, while he was meditating,and forgetful of everything else, the mate of the vessel had been hopingthat he would see the severe squall which was threatening, and was, eventhen, skimming fiercely over the troubled water. He feared to suggest toMr. Bowditch the importance of taking in sail, because the disciplineon board ship prevents an inferior officer from interfering with thesuperior, when the latter is on deck. At length, aroused by the dangerof the vessel, he ventured the remark, “Captain, would it not be betterto take in the topgallant sails?” These words aroused Mr. Bowditch fromhis reverie, and he instantly ordered all hands to duty, and fortunately,by his activity and energy, was enabled to furl the extra sail beforethe gust struck the vessel. But this event taught Mr. Bowditch a lesson;and he gave strict orders to the two officers mentioned above to waiveall ceremony with him, and to take the command of the ship whether hewas on deck or not. This rule was afterwards always observed, excepton difficult occasions; and then Mr. Bowditch assumed the authority ofcommanding officer. On these occasions, by his calmness and sagacityhe gained the respect and confidence of those in employment under him.Before the termination of this voyage, we shall see a striking exampleof this. But now let us proceed on our expedition with him, and againcross the Atlantic, pass around the Cape of Good Hope to the islandsof the Indian Ocean. But I should premise, that, as he had become moreacquainted with mathematics and philosophy, he had imported from Europemost of the great works on these subjects; and he now was prepared todevote himself more closely than ever to the darling object of hislife—the attainment of a knowledge of the truths of science. He wasdetermined, on this voyage, to undertake the thorough study of one workon the heavens—a book which he had understood was above anything everbefore written by man on that subject. Imagine, if you can, the zeal anddelight with which he must have approached this book upon a subject thathad interested him from earliest years. Doubtless he thought not, then,of the fame he was to gain from it. The name of it you will like to know.I shall speak of it again; but, meanwhile, I will merely mention thatit was called “A Treatise on the Mechanism of the Heavens,”—_MécaniqueCéleste_,—and was written, in French, by a mathematician named La Place,the greatest scientific man, after Newton, of modern times. But this wasnot the only work Mr. Bowditch took with him. He had many of the mostimportant works which had been published on the same subject, they havingbeen imported for him by a bookseller named Blunt, in payment of servicesrendered.[Sidenote: STUDIES AT SEA.]These various studies of course influenced his Journal. He was anobserver of passing events; but he recorded less of them than on thepreceding voyages.By the first record, it appears that on “Sunday, November 21, 1802, atone o’clock P. M., sailed from Captain Hill’s wharf, in Beverly. At two,passed Baker’s Island lights, with fine and pleasant breeze.” This fairweather lasted but a few days, and by far the greater part of the voyagewas uncomfortable, in consequence of the prevalence of rain and wind. OnJanuary 25, 1803, he saw the islands of Tristan d’Acunha, and, whilstcoursing along under easy sail, took several observations of them, andmade a chart of their various positions.[Sidenote: ARRIVAL AT SUMATRA.][Sidenote: VISIT TO ISLE OF FRANCE.][Sidenote: PEPPER ISLANDS.]On the 2d of May he arrived among the Pepper Islands, near the coast ofSumatra. He found several American captains there, all actively engagedin loading their vessels with pepper. He had considerable difficultyin making any arrangement with the Rajahs of different places; but atlength, having touched, without success, at several ports, he beganto load at Tally-Poo, on the 9th of May. There he continued until the18th of July, when, by his Journal, it appears that, having wasted anumber of days, expecting that more pepper would be brought to theshore, he at last was informed by the Rajah he would not be allowed anymore. Knowing that he should meet with equal trouble at every placeon the coast, he concluded to quit it, and call at the Isle of Franceon his homeward passage. During their voyage, amid the various shoalsand islands which abound here, they met with no inconvenience and nointerruption, save that they anchored once or twice, towards night, andon the 25th of July were obliged to heave to, under the fire of twoEnglish ships of war, one named the Royal George, the commander ofwhich took the liberty of searching, for the purpose of seeing whetherthere were any Englishmen on board.[6] The officer on this occasion wasvery polite, and the Putnam soon resumed its course, and in seventy-twohours more was on the open sea, under full sail, with the aid of thesteady trade-winds of that place and season. On the 24th of August thevessel was in sight of the Isle of France. He there met his old friendBonnefoy, whom he had left there on his first voyage, in 1795, andlikewise many American friends. After purchasing some bags of pepper, andtaking on board some provisions, which employed his time for four days,he sailed, for the last time from any foreign port, on Wednesday, August31, 1803. The voyage homeward was very disagreeable, in consequenceof much severe weather. Nothing remarkable happened to enliven thescene; but Mr. Bowditch disregarded the storms and waves. His mindwas calm and tranquil, for he was daily occupied with his “peacefulmathematics.” He wrote in his Journal but seldom. There is, however,the following account of the Pepper Islands. “There are several nativeports on the north-western coast of Sumatra, where the Americans tradefor pepper—Analaboo-Sooso, Tangar, Tally-Poo, Muckie, &c., and severalsmaller ports, including about fifty miles of the coast. On your arrivalat any of these ports, you contract with the Datoo for the pepper, andfix the price. If more than one vessel is at the port, the pepper whichdaily comes to the scales is shared between them, as they can agree,or they take it day by day, alternately. Sometimes the Datoo contractsto load one vessel before any other one takes any, and he holds to hisagreement _as long as he finds it for his interest, and no longer_; fora handsome present, or an increase in the price, will prevent any morepepper from being brought in for several days; and the person who hasmade the agreement must either quit the port or offer an additional price.[Sidenote: PEPPER TRADE.]“The pepper season commences in January, when they begin to take from thevines the small kernels at the bottom. In March, April, and May is theheight of the crop, at which time the pepper taken from the top of thevines is larger and more solid than that gathered at an earlier period.Many suppose that the pepper is all gathered in May; but I was in some ofthe gardens in July, and found at the top of the vines large quantitieswhich would be ripe in a few days. The young crop was in considerableforwardness at the bottom of the vines. Some calculate on two crops, butfrom the best information I could procure there is only one.“The pepper is generally weighed with American scales and weights,one hundred and thirty-three and a third pounds to a _peccul_. Whatis weighed each day is paid for in the evening, the natives not beingwilling to trust their property in the hands of those they deal with. Andthey ought to be dealt with in the same manner, it not being prudent topay in advance to the Datoo, as it would be often difficult to get eitherthe pepper or the money again from him. Spanish dollars are the currentcoin, but they do not take halves or quarters. They have a pang or piece,of which we could get but eighty for a dollar at Tally-Poo, though atother places they give one hundred or one hundred and twenty for thesame.”[Sidenote: NEARING THE COAST.][Sidenote: DANGERS OF THE COAST.][Sidenote: SKILL IN NAVIGATION.][Sidenote: ENTHUSIASM OF THE SAILORS.][Sidenote: HOME.]During the whole voyage, as I have already stated, the weather had beenvery uncomfortable. The approach to the American coast is at all timeshazardous during the winter. The bold and rocky shore, the intense coldand severe snow-storms, which make the day shorter even than common,are so many terrors for the sailor. You may judge of the anxiety of thecrew of the Putnam, when, after a tedious absence of more than a year,they at length, towards the middle of December, 1803, after a longperiod of stormy weather, came upon the shoal grounds off Massachusettsnear Nantucket. The sleet and rain had been driving over the oceanfor many days. No sun appeared to guide them by day; no star lightedup the night. Groping, as it were, in darkness, they coasted along upthe shore, yet not within sight of it, now throwing their sounding-lineupon Nantucket, and soon afterwards upon George’s Shoal. There seemedno end to the storm. At length, on the 25th of December, they hadapproached, according to Mr. Bowditch’s reckoning, from observationmade two days before, near to the outer part of Salem harbor. The nightwas fast closing in. Mr. Bowditch was observed to be on deck, anxiouslylooking towards the bow of the vessel, as if trying to see somethingthat would enable him to know more exactly the position of the vesseland the precise course it was running. With clear and decided tones,he gave his orders. The seamen heard him, and obeyed promptly. “Thereis something in the wind,” whispered one; “the _old man_[7] is above.”“Stand every man at his post,” is the command; “and look out for landahead.” Fierce gusts of wind swept over Massachusetts Bay, bearing thevessel irresistibly onwards. The snow-storm beat heavily, and at everymoment the darkness increased. At length, for a moment, the clouds ofdrifting snow-flakes parted, and Mr. Bowditch and his mate, who werewatching, saw distinctly the light of Baker’s Island. “Light, ho! onthe larboard bow,” was passed from one to the other on board that ship,in which were many almost breathless with suspense. It was but for amoment, and again all was obscured. “I am right,” said Mr. Bowditch; “thedirection in which we are now steering will carry us soon into Salemharbor.” His prediction was fulfilled, and it was an extraordinary proofof his skill in navigation. He had had no opportunity for observing thesun or moon for two or three days; yet, so accurately had he marked hisposition in the ocean at the last time of observing, that, by steeringin the direction pointed out by the chart, and observing the rate atwhich the vessel moved, he had been able to calculate so exactly, that,after seventy-two hours of darkness, as it were, he came up within sightof the light-house almost as easily as if he had been steering in openday, with the object distinctly in view. The old tars could not restraintheir expressions of admiration; and as, at nine o’clock in the evening,they dropped anchor in safety from the gale that was now beating withtenfold violence outside of the island, they whispered with one another,so that he overheard them, “The _old man_ has done well to-night.” It wasthe 25th of December, and throughout Christendom the Christmas festivalin commemoration of the birth of the Saviour had been celebrated, andfriends had all been gathered. Sadness marked their countenances at onehome, from which the husband and friend was absent, though long expected.As the blasts beat through the streets, and as the family clusteredaround the bright, shining fire upon the hearth-stone, as the windwhistled through the casement, the thoughts of the wife were turned fromthe fireside to the rough ocean on which her husband was tempest-tossed.Many weary weeks had she watched; but day after day had the sun gonedown, and, like Rachel, she could not be comforted. She feared that hewas lost. One after another of her friends had left her late at night,and finally she was alone. Suddenly she springs up from her seat, arousedby the sound of quick knocking at the street door. She recognizes thetap, and in a few moments she is hanging on his neck from whom she wasdestined never to be long separated, until death removed her from him forfour years, at the end of which time he was placed by death in quietnessat her side.CHAPTER VII.    Review of the labors, &c., performed by Mr. Bowditch, during    these voyages.—Habits while at sea; studies; desire to teach    others; kindness to sailors and to the sick.—Discovers errors    in a book on navigation.—Origin of “American Practical    Navigator;” success of it; industry of Mr. Bowditch upon    it.—Investigates higher branches of science.—“Mécanique    Céleste.”—Mr. Bowditch reads history.—Learns Spanish, French,    and Portuguese languages.—Anecdotes.—Chosen member of American    Academy.—Receives honors from Harvard College.[Sidenote: A REVIEW.][Sidenote: HABITS AT SEA.][Sidenote: TEACHES THE SAILORS.][Sidenote: CARES FOR THEM WHEN ILL.]Thus finished Mr. Bowditch’s career as a sailor, after he had been abouteight years engaged in this pursuit. Let us now review a little, and seewhat he was doing during these voyages, and how he occupied his time. Hewas very regular in his habits. During the first two voyages he attendedto the duties of mate of the vessel. This, of course, prevented him fromstudying as much as he otherwise would have done. He, moreover, as wehave seen, took fewer books with him. But during the next two voyages,the captain excused him from the watches, and he was able to read withless interruption. After the deck had been washed in the morning, hewalked for half an hour. He then went into the cabin to study, until thetime arrived at which he was to observe the sun. This was done every dayat noon, in order to tell whereabouts in the ocean a vessel is at themoment of the observation. Having finished this, he usually dined. Afterthis he slept a few moments, or took a walk, and then studied again untiltea time. After supper he was again at work until nine, when he used towalk for some time, cheerfully talking with his comrades. Afterwards heusually studied until late at night; and in order not to disturb hisfellow-passengers, he did not keep a light in the cabin, but frequentlystood upon the cabin stairway, reading by the light of the binnacle lamp,where the compass was kept. Whenever the vessel arrived at a port, hewas still engaged, but in a different way, perhaps. The instant he wasfreed from the duties of weighing pepper on the coast of Sumatra, he wentto his books. No time was wasted, either in foul or fair weather. It madeno difference to him whether the ship was resting motionless upon thewater, or tossing upon the heaviest swell, he was always a worker. Butthere was yet another and still more pleasant trait in his character.He not only loved study himself, but he was determined to persuade allothers to love it also. During his first voyage, he used to go to theforecastle, or sailor’s cabin, and carry his books of navigation, andteach the seamen how to guide a ship by the rules found in these books.He then went on deck, and explained to each one the method of using thequadrant and sextant, two instruments used by a sea captain. There was anold man formerly living in Salem, who, when speaking of this dispositionof Mr. Bowditch, said, “I was the steward onboard the vessel, and Mr.Bowditch frequently scolded me because I did not come to study with himmore steadily.” It is a fact that every sailor on board the ship duringthat voyage became afterwards captain, and probably some of them wouldnever have risen so high, had it not been for the kindness of theirfriend. I like to think of this trait in his character. He delighted inlearning for its own sake, and he was always pleased when he could findsome one upon whom he could bestow all his acquirements. He had no meanstandard of comparison between himself and his fellows, but desired togive and receive as much good as it was possible for him to bestow oraccept.He was beloved for this by all: but his kindness of heart led him notmerely to teach those who knew _less_ than he, but he did all he couldto relieve them when ill. One of them wrote in a letter answering myinquiries, after alluding to Mr. Bowditch’s willingness to teach others,“But kindness and attention to the poor seasick cabin-boy are to this day[April, 1838] uppermost in my memory, and will last when his learning isremembered no more.” He might have been as learned, without displayingthis regard for others. But he would not then have had such tributes oflove as was displayed by this old sailor, who remembered his kindnessrather than his instruction.[Sidenote: STUDY OF MATHEMATICS.][Sidenote: BOWDITCH’S NAVIGATOR.][Sidenote: ORIGIN OF IT.][Sidenote: SUCCESS.][Sidenote: FAVORABLE NOTICE.]But let us examine his particular studies pursued while at sea. We havealready seen that from a boy he had liked simple arithmetic, and onbecoming older had studied deeply into mathematics—a kind of learningsimilar in character to arithmetic, only much more difficult andimportant. During the long voyages to India, he had ample opportunityfor following this branch of science; consequently we find that he waschiefly occupied with that subject. On the first voyage he discoveredmany errors in a book on navigation, some of which were so important,that in consequence of them, not a few vessels had been shipwrecked.This erroneous work was originally published in London, by a man namedHamilton Moore, and it was almost the only one in use among seamen. Ithad been reprinted in America, in 1798, by Mr. Blunt, then living inNewburyport. One edition had been published, and a second was aboutto be issued, in 1799, when Mr. Blunt learned, by means of a mutualfriend, that Mr. Bowditch, during his two first voyages, had detectedmany of these errors, and was willing to inform him of them. Mr. Bluntimmediately made application to the young navigator, and received theassistance he wanted. Finding that Mr. Bowditch had within him themeans of rendering essential service, Mr. Blunt proposed to him, whenstarting on his fourth voyage,—that is, to India,—to examine all thetables, and see what number of errors he could find. Mr. Bowditch agreedto the proposal, and during this voyage his time was much occupied withthis task—a very wearisome, but, as it proved eventually, a profitableone, as it regards reputation and pecuniary success. The mistakeswere so numerous that he found it much easier to make a new work, andintroduce therein his own improvements: so that Mr. Bowditch, beforethe termination of the voyage, decided to make some arrangement forthis purpose. The consequence was, that, instead of publishing a thirdedition of Moore’s Navigator, in 1802, the first edition of the “AmericanPractical Navigator” was published by Mr. Bowditch, under his own name,Mr. Blunt being proprietor. Thus was laid, at the age of twenty-nine, thefoundation of a work on navigation that has kept constantly before thepublic, as one of the best of the kind, either in America or England.It passed through its tenth edition a short time before Mr. Bowditch’sdeath.[8] It soon superseded entirely Mr. Moore’s, and was earlyrepublished in London. And it was not only obtained by every Americanseaman, but even English ships sought for Bowditch’s Navigator as theirsafety during their long voyages. Many amusing anecdotes are related inreference to this book. An American captain once took passage in anEnglish ship from the Isle of France for St. Helena. After, being a fewdays out, the passenger, about noon, brought on deck his “Navigator” (oneof Bowditch’s editions) for the purpose of using it. While thus engaged,the English captain of the vessel walked up and looked at the work.“Why,” says he, “you use the same work that we do. Pray, where did youget that?” And great was the surprise of the Englishman, when he learnedthat the author of the book he was using every day of his life was thenear neighbor and friend of the person he was talking with. Little did heimagine that he was dependent upon the efforts of a son of an Americancooper for the information by which he was enabled to go from sea to seain comparative safety. But how is it that this work has been able toremain so long one of the best works of the kind? Because Mr. Bowditchbestowed very great pains upon it, and with every new edition made allthe improvements possible. He moreover brought all his learning to bearupon it. To use a common phrase, he put, for the time being, his “wholeheart into” making it as perfect as possible. In the explanations of therules he was simple, so that the most ignorant could understand them.But, in addition to all this, as we have already stated, he introducedall the new methods which he himself had discovered. One of these wasfavorably noticed by a celebrated French astronomer, in a Journalpublished in 1808.[Sidenote: PEACEFUL MATHEMATICS.]But, although his attention was much devoted to this book on navigation,he evidently considered it as of little moment, compared with moreimportant objects. During the long voyages he had been studying thehigher branches of the mathematics and their applications to thecalculation of the motions of the heavenly bodies. The interest he feltin these pursuits had a most pleasing effect upon him. If he were sad ordisturbed, he found quiet and cheerfulness in “his peaceful mathematics.”As arithmetic had been the darling pursuit of his boyhood, so now thecurious and intricate problems of mathematics, and the sublime theoriesof the planets, occupied his best leisure hours. We have seen that, longbefore going to sea, he studied French for the purpose of reading awork on mathematics. He continued to read with much interest the worksof that country. Some of you may know that about the close of the lastcentury, at the revolution in France, all the nation was aroused; everybranch of learning and of art received new life. The consequence was,that many men of the highest genius arose, and, being patronized bygovernment, they put forth to the world extraordinary works of learning.Most of these, when upon astronomy, Mr. Bowditch procured for himself,by means of the publisher of the “Navigator.” He was still engaged inextracting from various works, or, in other words, in filling up hisvolumes of manuscripts, though now, from the increase of his property,he was enabled to buy the originals; and of course his manuscripts werechiefly his sea journals, and the notes made by himself upon the variousauthors he read. But he did not confine himself entirely to science. Heread history, and some works of a literary character, but he never spentmuch time upon inferior books. “Why read anything you cannot speak of?”he used frequently to say. He likewise studied the Spanish, Italian, andPortuguese languages.[Sidenote: METHOD OF STUDYING LANGUAGES.][Sidenote: GERMAN VOCABULARY.]His mode of learning languages is instructive. As soon as he determinedto study one, he bought a Bible, Grammar, and Dictionary in that tongue.After learning a few of the pronouns and auxiliary verbs, he began totranslate, and usually commenced with the first chapter of the Gospel ofSt. John, because in the few first verses there are many repetitions.Having studied them thoroughly, he proceeded to other portions of theBible, with which he was most acquainted. He always carried to churcha Bible in the language he was studying, and used it, instead of anEnglish one, during the services. But he had another plan, which is veryuseful to one who has a bad memory. I will now explain to you one ofhis vocabularies, or collections of words, with their meanings attachedthereto, so arranged that he could refer much more easily to them thanto a common dictionary. He did not learn German until a long time afterthe period of his life of which we are now speaking; but as the Germanvocabulary is the most perfect, I will describe it. It is made upon twolarge sheets, one foot broad, and more than a foot and a half high,which, with the inside of the covers, make six pages. The pages aredivided into columns about one and a half inches wide, that is, largeenough to admit, in very small writing, a word with its significationby its side. Of course the columns are divided for the letters of thealphabet, in a manner proportioned to the number of pages of each letterin the dictionary. Having thus prepared his book, whenever he found thathe was obliged, for want of memory, to look at the dictionary more thanonce for the meaning of a word, he wrote it in his vocabulary, and, bythe act of writing, strengthened in some measure his memory of thatword; and, moreover, he could find it immediately, and not lose time asin turning over the leaves of a larger book. The number of words thusseen at a glance, as it were, is remarkable. In the above-described sixpages, there are eleven thousand German words, all written distinctly,but in small letters, and without any repetitions, and with as manyabbreviations as he himself chose. I have been thus minute upon thissubject, not because I think that all ought to make vocabularies, butbecause some may be benefited by so doing. Moreover, I wished to speak toyou of them as proofs of his perseverance.[Sidenote: ACADEMY OF ARTS.][Sidenote: HARVARD COLLEGE HONORS.]Two important events took place during this period of Mr. Bowditch’slife, which it becomes our duty to record. On the 28th day of May, 1799,he was chosen a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Thissociety was the first which bestowed upon him the honor of membershipof its body. It is composed of men of science, combined for the purposeof improving themselves and the community in knowledge. He continued amember of this body during his life; and in May, 1829, just thirty yearsafter becoming a member, he was chosen its president, in which office hewas continued until the day of his death.[Sidenote: RESULTS OF GOOD USE OF TIME.]Another honor, and one which was more pleasant to him than any receivedat any time afterwards, was bestowed during this period. In 1802 his shipwas wind-bound in Boston, and he left it for the purpose of attending theannual commencement at Cambridge College. He knew but few individualsthere, though he had corresponded with some of the professors; and oneof the corporation of the college, Chief Justice Parsons, was one ofhis kindest friends. He went alone, and, while listening in the crowdto the names of those upon whom the honors were conferred, he thoughthe heard his own pronounced; but he supposed that he might have beenmistaken, inasmuch as the notice was given in Latin. But how great washis emotion, when he heard from a friend that his suspicions were wellfounded! It was to him the proudest day of his life. And we, who know hishumble origin, his simplicity and modesty, can in some measure understandthe thrill of pleasure that ran through him, when he found himself thusnoticed by the first and oldest university in the land. And why was hethus noticed? Because he had well improved the hours of his life; becausehis days and nights had been spent in activity and earnest study. Inafter-life, when his fame was established, and the great societies ofEurope bestowed upon him their diplomas, he always looked upon them asof small moment, compared with this his first, earliest proof of esteemfrom his fellow-men. I will take this opportunity to state that very manyyears afterwards he was elected one of the corporation of the college.This he deemed his highest honor, and his estimate was a just one, forit placed him among the select few who manage the whole affairs of theuniversity—a place doubtless coveted by many, but to which few arecalled.[Sidenote: NEW SCENES.]Having now completed his sea life, let us enter upon his new scene ofenergy and benevolence as a citizen and father; and our next chapter willinclude several years of his residence at Salem.CHAPTER VIII._From 1803 to 1817—age, 30-44._    Mr. Bowditch translates a Spanish paper; is chosen president    of a Fire and Marine Insurance office.—Habits of life.—Becomes    interested in politics.—Federalists and Democrats.—Great    excitement.—Division between him and old friends in    consequence of his zeal.—Feelings of Mr. Bowditch when war    was declared.—Decision of character.—His charity.—Earnestness    in aiding others; ludicrous instance of the effects of    this.—Boldness towards a truckman.—Zeal for improving the    libraries; unites the two.—Dr. Prince’s church.—Performance    of duties of president of Insurance Office.—Answer to an    overbearing rich man.—Appointed professor of mathematics at    Harvard College; same at West Point.—His modesty.—Hints about    leaving Salem.[Sidenote: KNOWLEDGE OF SPANISH.][Sidenote: ADVANTAGE OF STUDY.][Sidenote: PRESIDENT OF INSURANCE COMPANY.][Sidenote: REGULAR HABITS.]Mr. Bowditch, on his arrival from sea, met with one of those events towhich he always referred when any one doubted the expediency of anykind of knowledge. In his voyages to Portugal and Spain, he had becomeacquainted with the Spanish language. It so happened that no one elsein Salem was acquainted with it, and an important paper came to thecare of a sturdy and sensible old sea captain; but it was unfortunatelyunintelligible to him, for it was written in this same unknown tongue.A friend suggested to him that probably Mr. Bowditch would decipher itfor him. The document was handed to Mr. Bowditch, who in a few daysreturned it with a free English translation accompanying it. The oldsailor was delighted, and immediately supposed that any one who knew somuch about a foreign language must be a very superior person, and capableof performing any duties. Moreover, he was delighted with the apparentgenerosity of Mr. Bowditch, in making the translation without charge tohis employer. It happened at this time that an insurance office in Salemwas in need of a president. The captain was one of the directors of thisinstitution, and used all his influence in promoting the election ofhis young friend. This influence succeeded, and in 1804, when he wasthirty-one years old, we find Mr. Bowditch installed as president of theEssex Fire and Marine Insurance Company. In this office he continued,with entire success, until 1823, when he removed to Boston, and tookcharge of other similar but much larger institutions. The relief wasgreat which he experienced from not being obliged to seek subsistencefor his family by continuing in the sailor’s life. The duties of theoffice in which he now engaged _seemed_ to occupy all his time; yethe did not neglect science. He arose at six in the morning during theyear, and took a walk, either before or after breakfast, of at leasttwo miles. Afterwards he studied mathematics until nine, and he thenwent to the office, where he continued until one. After another walk hedined, and after a short sleep he again visited his office until teatime. From tea time until nine in the evening he was at the same placeoccupied with business. He was not, however, all the time, during officehours, actually engaged in the necessary work incident to his positionas president; but he was constantly liable to interruption, as much ashe had been when an apprentice. Yet he found leisure enough for study byearly rising and by regular habits. He used to say, “Before nine o’clockin the morning I learned all my mathematics.” He kept some of his bookson science at his office, and whenever a moment of leisure occurred,spent the time in reading them. At home he had no private room for manyyears; and, as his family of young children grew up around him, hestudied at his simple pine desk, in the midst of their noise and play. Hewas never disturbed, except when they failed in kindness to one another,and then he could never work until quiet was restored. In truth, theinfluence of his studies was felt by his children, whose greatest rewardwas to receive from him, in token of his approbation, the drawings ofvarious constellations upon their arms or forehead. It was a sad day forthem when they did not receive from his pen the representation of theBelt of Orion, the Great Bear, or of some other beautiful constellationin the heavens.[Sidenote: POLITICAL EXCITEMENT.][Sidenote: PARTY POLITICS.]But, in addition to the duties of his office, he became interested inthe political affairs of the day. After the revolution, and the newgovernment of the country went into operation under the presidency ofGeneral Washington, there had been but little political excitement inEssex County. There were no great parties, which were destined soonafterwards to spring up and excite the bitterest animosity betweenindividuals who had been from birth the warmest friends. It would beimpossible, were it useful, to tell all the causes that led to theformation of the two great sects in politics, called the Federalists andRepublicans. Suffice it to say, that even during Washington’s connectionwith the government, the seeds of this division were beginning tospring up, and, upon the accession of John Adams, as his successor, thepolitical rancor between these two parties increased with tenfold energy,until at length the republican party triumphed in the election of ThomasJefferson to the office of President of the United States. In Salem theviolence of party spirit rose as high as in any city of the Union. Itwould have been surprising, with his desire for aiding any public cause,if Mr. Bowditch had not been influenced by the excitements of the day. Wefrequently find at the bottom of a page, or at the end of some theorem,brief memoranda of the results of an election. He was, moreover, fortwo years a member of the State Council. He was likewise proposed bythe Federalists as a representative to the General Court, but at thatelection they were defeated.[Sidenote: PEACEFUL MATHEMATICS.]We have scarcely any idea of the violence with which the two partiescontended. Persons who had been, during life, sincere and devotedfriends, were separated by this virulence. Mr. Bowditch suffered asmuch as others on this account, and two of his longest and best-triedfriends he did not have any intercourse with for many years. Dr. Bentleyand Captain Prince were these persons, and with both of them youare already acquainted. It was not until 1817, when President Monroevisited these Northern States, that harmony was restored between thetwo great divisions, and friends once more embraced each other. But,in the midst of all this excitement with politics, Mr. Bowditch neverneglected the duties of his office, or his studies. In fact, the pursuitof learning had, as before, a sweet influence over his character. Itstill gave calmness when circumstances around him tended to disturb him.An illustration of this you may find in what follows. In 1812, aftera long series of supposed insults and wrongs from Great Britain, theAmerican government declared war against that power. Mr. Bowditch wasmuch distressed by the news, and for two days was so much overcome thathe was unable to study. Friends who knew him had never seen him lookso sad before on any public emergency. He could speak of nothing butthe disasters that he foresaw war would entail upon his country. On themorning of the third day he got up, and, going down into the parlor,said to his wife, “It won’t do for me to continue in this way. I _willnot_ think any more about it.” Saying this, he retired again to hisbooks. The difference in his whole manner was very perceptible. He rarelyafterwards allowed himself to be disturbed by the unfortunate state ofaffairs. Such should always be the benign influences of the study ofscience and of Nature’s laws.[Sidenote: CHARITY.][Sidenote: ANECDOTE.][Sidenote: A RIDICULOUS JUDGE.][Sidenote: KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.]Amid all these various engagements, he was full of sympathy for others.Wherever he saw he could aid with his counsel, he did so; and many widowsand orphans have felt the influence of his charity. This charity showeditself chiefly in a desire to improve others. There was scarcely oneof those connected with him in friendship upon whom he did not devotesome time for their instruction. To one young lady he taught French,and another studied Italian with him. If a young man needed funds, heknew upon whom he could call with a certainty of substantial aid, evenif he had no money of his own to give away, for throughout life it wasone of the remarkable attributes of Mr. Bowditch’s character, that hecould persuade many to open their hearts to the poor, who, upon otheroccasions, were deaf to the common feelings of humanity. For one youngperson of this kind Mr. Bowditch obtained a subscription sufficient toenable him to continue at the university, whereas his young friend wouldhave been unable to do so without assistance. He was always so zealousin these undertakings, that one scarcely felt under any obligations tohim. It was his delight to help, and every one saw that his heart wasengaged in the cause. His zeal for humanity was at times immoderate, andthe following laughable law case occurred in consequence of it. One dayhe was informed that a little girl, who lived with him, had been run overby some careless driver; and a crowd, which he could perceive at a littledistance from him, was a collection of individuals drawn together on heraccount. He immediately ran forward, and getting to the outside of thecircle, began very energetically to make his way into it. In doing so,he pulled one of the bystanders so forcibly, that the individual, as itwill appear in the sequel, was offended. Arriving, however, by dint ofhard pushing, at the object of his search, he took his little domesticwith him, and led her safely home. On the next day he was much surprisedat receiving a summons from a justice of the peace, to appear before him,to answer to the charge of assault and battery upon the individual abovementioned. He answered the call and paid his fine of a few dollars; butthe judge, who had been notorious for always making both parties suffer,when it was possible for himself to gain thereby, said, on receivingthe fine, “But you say that Mr. —— _pushed_ you, after you had _pulled_him.” “I did, sir.” “Very well; then, if you wish to complain of him,I will fine him likewise.” The ludicrous nature of the whole actionstruck Mr. Bowditch so forcibly that he was not unwilling to increasethe folly of it. The plaintiff was then fined, and the affair was ended.It is but right to say, that the judge was considered, previously tothis, one entirely unfit for the office. Probably no other would haveissued a summons on such an occasion, and the plaintiff was not unjustlypunished for having called upon such a person to aid him in prosecutingan individual who, in exerting himself to help another, had slightlydisarranged the dress of a bystander.Mr. Bowditch’s desire to aid the unfortunate was exhibited onanother occasion, when a poor, overladen horse was the object of hiscommiseration. A truckman had been violently beating the animal, in orderto induce him to pull along a very heavy load, which was too large forhis strength. Mr. Bowditch had watched the driver for some time, and atlength he stepped earnestly forward, and in abrupt and decided tonesordered him to desist. The truckman was much superior to Mr. Bowditch inpersonal strength, and was, at first, disposed to ridicule the attemptof his inferior to restrain him. Full of indignation, Mr. Bowditch criedout, “If you dare touch that horse again, and if you do not immediatelygo and get another to assist him, I will appeal to the law, and you willsee which of us two will conquer.” The man yielded, and Mr. Bowditch wenthome.[Sidenote: MARINE SOCIETY.]The public institutions of the town felt his influence. The East IndiaMarine Society, of which I have already spoken, improved very muchunder his auspices as president. It had fallen considerably during highpolitical times, and, when he was chosen chief officer, he instilled suchzeal among the younger members of it, and obtained so many new members,that it revived; and soon after his removal to Boston, the splendid hallwas erected, containing the most remarkable collection of East Indiacuriosities, of which I spoke in Chapter VI.[Sidenote: SALEM LIBRARIES.]In the libraries he had always felt very much interest. You alreadyknow what reason he had for being devoted to the Philosophical Library,for from it he drew most of his knowledge of science. But there wasanother, which had been in existence much longer than this, called theSocial Library. The books contained in these two collections were almostwholly distinct in their characters. In one only works of science wereto be found, while the other was chiefly devoted to literature. Mr.Bowditch saw that both of them united would be of great service to thecommunity, for it would not merely combine the books, but the energiesof the proprietors. Consequently it appears that he, with another of thePhilosophical Library proprietors, was chosen a committee for the purposeof providing for a union. This was happily effected (1810), and the SalemAthenæum arose from the combination. The rooms over his office werechosen as the place for their deposit, and for many years he was one ofthe most active of the trustees.There was another institution with which he was intimately connectedduring the whole of the time he lived in Salem. I allude to the churchin which his early friend, Rev. Dr. Prince, officiated. He was one ofthe committee of the parish, and, though never a member of the churchstrictly so called, he was a constant attendant upon the services, andhad great influence in keeping up the harmony and supporting the trueinterests of the congregation.[Illustration: DR. BOWDITCH’S RESIDENCE AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH.][Sidenote: DEFENDS THE WEAK.]In the performance of his duties as president of the insurance company,he was faithful and prompt in action. He was frequently placed incircumstances which required great decision of character. At times adisposition was shown to deceive him; at others, a richer stockholderwould attempt to gain advantages over a poorer one. I well remember ananecdote in which it is said a purse-proud rich man tried to browbeat Mr.Bowditch into doing an act which Mr. Bowditch thought would be unjust toanother poorer one. The nabob pleaded his riches, and amount of his stockin the office, and intimated that he would have his way. “No, sir, youwon’t. I stand here in this place to see justice done, and, as long asI am here, I will defend the weak.” He seldom met with difficulties ofthis kind, for few dared approach him with the intention to be unjust oruntrue. Nothing aroused him so much to an almost lion-like fierceness asany appearance of wickedness in the transaction of public business. Hehad much wisdom, likewise, in the selection of risks, so that the office,while under his control, succeeded admirably and he left it prosperous.[Sidenote: PROFESSORSHIP OF MATHEMATICS.][Sidenote: EXTREME MODESTY.]During his residence in Salem he was often invited to seats of honorand trust. We have already mentioned his political course. In 1806, bythe agency of Chief Justice Parsons, then in the corporation of HarvardCollege, he was appointed professor of mathematics in that university.In 1818 he was requested by President Jefferson, in very flatteringterms, to accept of a similar office in the University of Virginia. In1820, he was called upon by the secretary of war of the United States, toconsent to an appointment at the Public Military School at West Point.All of these he refused, as not congenial to his mind. He always declinedtalking in public. He would teach all who came to him, but he could notdeliver a public course of lectures. His extreme modesty prevented. Forit will be remembered that he was as remarkable, from his youth, for hismodesty, amounting, in early life, to diffidence, as he was for his otherqualities. Moreover, it should be stated that, at times, he had a certainhesitation in his mode of speaking, which probably would have preventedhim from addressing easily a public audience.In 1818, he was urged to take charge of an insurance office in Boston,but he preferred living in his native place.CHAPTER IX._From 1803 to 1823—age, 30-50._    Papers published by Mr. Bowditch in the Memoirs of the Academy;    account of some of them.—Total eclipse of the sun in 1806;    effect of it.—Anecdote of Chief Justice Parsons.—Meteor that    fell over Weston, Ct.; account of its curious appearance;    effect of these papers upon his fame in Europe.—Chosen member    of most of the learned societies of the Old World.—Quits Salem    to become connected with larger institutions in Boston.[Sidenote: EMPLOYMENT IN POLITICAL TIMES.][Sidenote: TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.][Sidenote: MR. BOWDITCH OBSERVES IT.][Sidenote: EFFECTS OF THE ECLIPSE.]It should be remembered, that, during these stormy political times, Mr.Bowditch was chiefly engaged in making his notes on the great work towhich we have already alluded, La Place’s “Mécanique Céleste,” and thatit was between the years 1800 and 1820, that is, during this same time,that he wrote twenty-three papers, which were published in the Memoirsof the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Of some of these last Iwill give you an account. Of the others, were I to mention them, youcould understand but little. They relate chiefly to observations madeupon the moon; the comets of 1807 and 1811; the eclipses of the sunwhich took place in 1806 and 1811; measurements of the height of theWhite Mountains, in New Hampshire; observations on the compass; on apendulum supported by two points; and the correction of some mistakesin one of the books studied first by him in early life, called Newton’s“Principia.” A few of these papers I will try to explain to you, atleast in part. I commence with his observation upon a total eclipse ofthe sun, which occurred June 16, 1806. I shall quote nearly the wordsof the observer. “On the day of the eclipse the weather was remarkablyfine, scarcely a cloud being visible in any part of the heavens. Imade preparations for the observations in the garden adjoining thehouse in which I reside, near the northern part of Summer Street, inSalem. Having been disappointed in procuring a telescope of a largemagnifying power, I was obliged to make use of that attached to mytheodolite, which gave very distinct vision, though its magnifyingpower was small. An assistant was seated near me, who counted theseconds from a chronometer, and thus enabled me to mark down with apencil, the time when the first impression was made on the sun, withouttaking my eye from the telescope till four or five seconds had elapsed,and the eclipse had sensibly increased, after which I examined thesecond and minute hands of the chronometer, and took every precautionto prevent mistakes. Four or five minutes before the commencement ofthe eclipse, I began to observe that part of the sun where the firstcontact [of the moon’s shadow] was expected to take place; and eightminutes twenty-eight seconds after ten o’clock, I observed the firstimpression. As the eclipse advanced, there did not appear to be so greata diminution of the light as was generally expected; and it was nottill the sun was nearly covered that the darkness was very sensible.The last ray of light disappeared instantaneously. The moon was thenseen surrounded by a luminous appearance of considerable extent, suchas has been generally taken notice of in total eclipses of the sun.” Anumber of stars became visible. The observer mentions that the lightin the garden was not entirely gone; but in the house candles wereneeded, as if it were evening. At thirty-two minutes eighteen secondsafter eleven o’clock,—that is, at a little more than an hour from thebeginning of the eclipse,—the first returning ray of light burst forthwith great splendor. I have heard that the effect upon those who saw itwas surpassingly grand. Suddenly the light of midday seemed to break inupon the quiet of evening. So completely were all the animal creationdeceived, that the cows returned lowing homeward, and the fowls soughttheir roosts, and quietly placed their heads under their wings. All humanbeings were looking in mute amazement, and deep silence prevailed, asthe dark shadow of the moon came stealing over the surface of the sunat noon. There was something fearful when the sun was wholly covered.Suddenly a bright ray shot forth mid heaven, and fell upon the earth,and with it arose a loud shout from the assembled crowd. Aged men[9] andwomen joined in the chorus, and saluted again the beautiful sunlight.This paper, though short, is one of the most important he ever wrote. Ina note to it he first mentions publicly a mistake he had discovered inthe “Mécanique Céleste.”[Sidenote: METEORS.][Sidenote: OBSERVATIONS OF ONE OF THEM.]In 1815, Mr. Bowditch published another paper, which I may be able toexplain to you in some degree. You have all heard of falling stars,or meteors, and probably most of you have seen them frequently, whenwalking at night, when the sky is clear. Some of these are very small;they seem at a great distance. They suddenly appear in our heavens,and as suddenly disappear, and perhaps nothing more is heard or seenof them. Others, on the contrary, appear larger, and fall to the earthafter having traversed a great portion of the heavens. On the 14th ofDecember, 1807, one of the most curious exploded, and fell over Weston,in Connecticut. Mr. Bowditch, in his Memoir, writes thus:—“The extraordinary meteor which appeared at Weston, in Connecticut, onthe 14th of December, 1807, and exploded with several discharges ofstones, having excited great attention throughout the United States,and being one of those phenomena of which few exact observations areto be found in the history of physical science, I have thought thata collection of the best observations of its appearance at differentplaces, with the necessary deductions for determining, as accuratelyas possible, the height, direction, velocity, and magnitude of thebody, would not be unacceptable to the Academy, since facts of thiskind, besides being objects of great curiosity, may be useful in theinvestigation of the origin and nature of these meteors; and as themethods of making these calculations are not fully explained in anytreatise of trigonometry common in this country, I have given thesolutions of two of the most necessary problems, with examples calculatedat full length. The second problem is not, to my knowledge, given in anytreatise of spherics. The observations of the meteor, which, after manyinquiries, were found to have been made with sufficient accuracy to beintroduced in the present investigation, were those made at Wenham, aboutseven miles north-easterly of Salem, by Mrs. Gardner, a very intelligentlady, who had an opportunity of observing it with great attention; thoseat Weston, by Judge Wheeler and Mr. Staples; and those at Rutland, inVermont, by William Page, Esq.” After giving the requisite solutions,he proceeds: “Some time after the appearance of the meteor, I wentwith Mr. Pickering to Mrs. Gardner’s house, at Wenham, where she hadobserved the phenomenon. She informed us that on the morning of the14th of December, 1807, when she arose, she went towards the window ofher chamber, which looks to the westward, for the purpose of observingthe weather, according to her invariable practice for many years past.The sky was clear, except a few thin clouds in the west. It was pastdaybreak, and, by estimation, about half an hour before sunrise, or seveno’clock. The meteor was immediately observed just over the southern partof the barn in her farm-yard, nearly in front of the window; its diskwas well defined, and it resembled the moon so much, that, unprepared asMrs. G.’s mind was for a phenomenon of that nature, she was not at firstaware that it was not the moon, till she perceived it in motion, when herfirst thought (to use her own words) was, ‘Where is the moon going to?’The reflection, however, was hardly made, when she corrected herself, andwith her eye followed the body with the closest attention throughout itswhole course. It moved in a direction nearly parallel to the horizon, anddisappeared behind a cloud northward of the house of Samuel Blanchard,Esq. She supposed the meteor to have been visible about half a minute.“The attention of Judge Wheeler was first drawn by a sudden flash oflight, which illuminated every object. Looking up, he discovered, inthe north, a globe of fire just then passing behind the cloud whichobscured, though it did not entirely hide, the meteor. In this situationits appearance was distinct and well defined, like that of the sun seenthrough a mist. It rose from the north, and proceeded in a directionnearly perpendicular to the horizon, but inclining by a very small angleto the west, and deviating a little from the plane of a great circle, butin pretty large curves, sometimes on one side of the plane and sometimeson the other, but never making an angle with it of more than four orfive degrees. Its apparent diameter was about one half or two thirds theapparent diameter of the full moon. Its progress was not so rapid as thatof common meteors and shooting stars. When it passed behind the thinnerclouds, it appeared brighter than before; and when it passed the spotsof clear sky, it flashed with a vivid light, yet not so intense as thelightning of a thunder-storm. Where it was not too much obscured by thickclouds, a waving, conical train of paler light was seen to attend it,in length about ten or twelve diameters of the body. In the clear skya brisk scintillation was observed about the body of the meteor, likethat of a burning firebrand carried against the wind. It disappearedabout fifteen degrees short of the zenith, and about the same number ofdegrees west of the meridian. It did not vanish instantaneously, butgrew, pretty rapidly, fainter and fainter, as a red-hot cannon-ball woulddo if cooling in the dark, only with much more rapidity. The whole periodbetween its first appearance and total extinction was estimated at aboutthirty seconds. About thirty or forty seconds after this, three loud anddistinct reports, like those of a four-pounder near at hand, were heard.Then followed a rapid succession of reports less loud, so as to produce acontinued rumbling. This noise continued about as long as the body wasin rising, and died away, apparently, in the direction from which themeteor came. Mr. Staples observed that when the meteor disappeared, therewere apparently three successive efforts or leaps of the fire-ball, whichgrew more dim at every throe, and disappeared with the last. From thevarious accounts which we have received of the appearance of the body, atdifferent places, we are inclined to believe that the time between thedisappearance and report, as estimated by Judge Wheeler, is too little,and that a minute is the least time that could have intervened.[Sidenote: OBSERVATION OF THEM.][Sidenote: THEIR NATURE.]“The observations made at Rutland were procured by the kind officesof Professor Hall, of Middlebury College, Vermont, to whom Mr. Pagecommunicated his valuable observations, in a paper expressed in thefollowing terms: ‘I was at the west door of my house, on Monday morning,the 14th of December, 1807, about daylight; and perceiving the skysuddenly illuminated, I raised my eyes and beheld a meteor of a circularform, in the south-westerly part of the heavens, rapidly descending tothe south, leaving behind it a vivid, sparkling train of light. Theatmosphere near the south part of the horizon was very hazy; but thepassage of the meteor behind the clouds was visible until it descendedbelow the mountains, about twenty miles south of this place. There werewhite, fleecy clouds scattered about the sky, but none so dense asto obscure the track of the meteor. I now lament that I did not makemore particular observations at the time; and I should probably, untilthis day, have considered it to be what is commonly called a “fallingstar,” had I not read in the New York papers an account of the explosionof a meteor, and the falling of some meteoric stones near New Haven,Connecticut, which, by recurring to circumstances then fresh in myrecollection, I found to be on the same morning that I observed themeteor at Rutland. I am indebted to my learned friend Dr. Samuel Williamsfor his aid and directions in ascertaining the situation of the meteorwhen I first observed it, and its course, and also for the order of myobservations: Form, circular; magnitude, less than a quarter of thediameter of the moon; color, red, vivid light; tail, or train of light,about eight times the length of its diameter, at the least, projectedopposite to its course.’”I quote these to give you some idea of the appearance of this meteor, andlikewise of Mr. Bowditch’s diligence. From the examination of all theaccounts given him, he came to the conclusion that the body moved at therate of more than three miles per second, and at the height of eighteenmiles above the surface of the earth. With regard to the magnitude of thebody, the results were less accurate; and the probability is, that allthe body did not fall, but merely passed through the air, and continuedon its course into unknown regions of space.[10][Sidenote: EUROPEAN FAME.][Sidenote: ACADEMIC HONORS.]The other papers I shall not mention, because they are upon subjectsdifficult to be comprehended. The last appeared in the volumes of theMemoirs of the Academy published in 1820. All these papers were read bythe astronomers and mathematicians of Europe, and the consequence was,that Mr. Bowditch was chosen a member of many of the learned societiesinstituted there for the promotion of science. In 1818 he was chosen intothe Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh, and in the year followingwas enrolled on the list of the Royal Irish Academy. While I am uponthis subject, I would state that he afterwards was elected associateof the Astronomical Society of London, of the Academies of Berlin andPalermo, and had a correspondence with most of the astronomers of Europe.The National Institute of France was about choosing him one of itscandidates for the position of foreign member, only eight of which arechosen from the whole world. He died before any election was held.[Sidenote: LITERARY LABORS.]In addition to the papers to the Academy, Mr. Bowditch published severalarticles in reviews, &c. One of them is an interesting history of modernastronomy, which is intended to give us an account of the lives anddoings of the most celebrated astronomers of modern times. Such were hisprincipal literary labors, and the greater part of them were performedduring his residence in Salem.The article on modern astronomy was prepared a few years after hisremoval to Boston. To that removal let us now turn. In 1823 overtureswere made to him to control two institutions in Boston, one for lifeinsurance, the other for marine risks. The offers were too liberal forhim to refuse. His duties to his family compelled him to accept them. Onhis determination being known, his fellow-citizens paid him a pleasanttribute of respect and love by inviting him to a public and farewelldinner.[Sidenote: REMOVAL TO BOSTON.]As the family left Salem, Mr. Bowditch and his wife often thought that,after remaining eight or ten years at Boston, they would return, in orderthat their bodies might be laid by the side of those of their ancestors.But new friends awaited them in Boston; new ties were formed there; andalthough they always looked to their native place as the seat of many oftheir most beloved associations, they both lived in Boston until theirdeaths.His engagements of a public nature, during his residence in Boston, weresimilar to those he had whilst at Salem. For many years he managed bothof the institutions to which he had been called. But the directors,finding that the duties of one were sufficient to occupy all hisattention, broke up the Marine Insurance Company, and Mr. Bowditch (orDr. Bowditch, as he was now generally called, having received the degreeof Doctor of Laws from Harvard University in 1816) devoted himself tothe life insurance office. This he raised to be one of the greatestinstitutions in New England. By an alteration in the charter, proposedby Dr. Bowditch, this became, in fact, a great savings bank, whereimmense sums are now yearly put in trust for widows and orphans. Theonly difference in his habits, caused by his removal to Boston, was anenlargement of his sphere of labor. All objects of public utility stillengaged his attention.The system of popular lectures, of which we have now so many, commencedwith the Mechanic Institution of which he was the first president. Hewas zealous for the improvement of the Boston Athenæum, and was veryinfluential towards getting for it large sums of money, and in making itmore liberal in its rules.[Sidenote: SERVICES TO HARVARD COLLEGE.]An honor was conferred upon him, after his arrival in Boston, which hethought as high as any ever received. Having had two honorary degreesfrom Harvard University, and having been one of the board of overseersof that institution for many years, he was finally chosen a member ofthe corporation, or council of seven men, who guide the whole of theconcerns of that important institution. How different the commencementand termination of the career of the poor son of a cooper, who at tenyears of age left school, and yet at the end of life was one of the chiefdirectors in the first literary institution in America!CHAPTER X.    Sketch of the life of La Place, author of the “Mécanique    Céleste.”—Newton’s labors.—Halley’s comet.—The importance of    astronomy to navigation.—Comets; Dr. Bowditch translates the    Mécanique Céleste; difficulties attending the undertaking;    objects he had in view; first volume analyzed; Newton’s error    pointed out.[Sidenote: MÉCANIQUE CÉLESTE.]In a former part of this story of Dr. Bowditch’s life, you will rememberthat I stated that on his last voyage he commenced his notes upon the“Mécanique Céleste” of La Place. It was on the first day of November,during his disagreeable voyage homewards, in 1803, that he wrote hisfirst note to the work which was destined to occupy much of his time fromthat moment until his death, thirty-five years afterwards, in Boston.This work certainly deserves some of our attention, if he thought itworthy of receiving the attention of so many years of his life. A briefaccount of the life of the author of the original work may interest you,and will serve as an introduction to the book itself.[Sidenote: LA PLACE.][Sidenote: SKETCH OF HIS LIFE.]Pierre Simon La Place was born on the 23d of March, in the year 1749,at Beaumont, on the borders of the beautiful and fertile country ofancient Normandy, situated in the north-western part of France. He wasthe son of simple peasants in that country, and from his earliest yearswas remarkable for the extraordinary powers of memory, and intenselove of study, with which he was endowed. In early life every branchof learning was delightful to him. He seemed eager to gain knowledgemerely, without regard to the object of his study. But he soon began todistinguish himself upon the subject of theology. This pursuit, however,was soon ended, and by some means, of which no details now remain, hismind was led to mathematics, and from that moment he was devoted tothem. After spending his youth at his native place, and having taughtmathematics there, he, at the age of eighteen years, went to Paris, toseek a wider sphere in his pursuit of knowledge. Bearing several lettersof recommendation as a youth of great promise, he presented himself atthe abode of D’Alembert, who at that time was the first mathematicianof France, and contended with Euler, at Berlin, for the honor of beingthe first in the world. But the letters upon which the youth dependedso much proved of no use. D’Alembert passed them by in silent neglect,without even deigning to receive at his own house the bearer of them.But La Place was fully bent upon success, and relying upon the force ofhis own genius as a more powerful recommendation than any letters, hesent to D’Alembert an essay, written by himself, upon a very abstrusesubject relating to mechanics. The professor, struck with its eleganceand the great learning displayed by it, soon afterwards called upon thewriter, and addressed him in these words: “You see, sir, that I thinkrecommendations are worth but very little; and for yourself they arewholly unnecessary. By your own writings you can make yourself betterknown than by any other means. They are sufficient. I will do all Ican for you.” In a few days after this conversation, the young manwas appointed professor of mathematics in the public military schoolat Paris. From this period until the end of his life he was occupiedupon the science which he was thus called, at this early age, to teachpublicly at the capital of France. He became daily more acquainted withthe great men of the nation, and was himself making additions to thescientific acquirements of the age, thus giving eminent proofs of hisgenius. He was chosen member of the French Academy, a society of learnedmen united for the purpose of advancing the cause of learning, and hestood soon very high amongst them.[Sidenote: MÉCANIQUE CÉLESTE.][Sidenote: GENIUS OF LA PLACE.]His chief work, the “Celestial Mechanics,”—“_Mécanique Céleste_,”—hebegan to publish in 1799, and finished the fourth volume in 1805.[11]This placed him much above all his contemporaries. In it he had not onlycombined many things which he himself had discovered, but likewise gave ahistory, as it were, of all that had been done by geometricians from thetime of Sir Isaac Newton until his own day. La Place found many thingsdetached, but his genius proved that many apparently discordant factscould be explained by Newton’s theory of universal gravitation. His labormust have been immense. All Europe rang with the fame of this production,which was said to be beyond anything ever performed before by man. Theecho of its fame reached America, and Dr. Bowditch obtained the volumes,as they were successively published. The first two he received in partpayment for his labors on the “Navigator.”Soon after his arrival home from his fourth voyage, Dr. Bowditch wastaking his accustomed walk towards the lower part of the town of Salem,and met his old friend, Captain Prince. They entered into conversation,and Dr. Bowditch remarked that he had, a short time before, received abook from France, which he had long wished for, having heard that it wassuperior to anything ever before written by man, and which very few wereable to comprehend. This work was that to which I have been alluding,and it now renders Dr. Bowditch’s own name familiarly known amongmathematicians.[Sidenote: SYSTEM OF THE WORLD.]Later in life, La Place published a work called the “System of theWorld.” In this, which, comparatively speaking, is not difficult to beread by almost any one, he attempts to give a plain and simple statementof all that is known in regard to those wise and magnificent laws,whereby this solar system is kept together in perfect harmony, while atthe same time it is sailing onward through fields of space.[Sidenote: LA PLACE A SENATOR.][Sidenote: DR. BOWDITCH’S LABORS.]La Place, however, was not a truly noble man, because he was not strictlyjust. It is said that he was willing to attribute to himself thediscoveries of others. On Napoleon Bonaparte’s becoming first consul inFrance, La Place was made one of the ministers of the state; but he wassoon found to be better fitted for study than for the practical dutiesof a public office. Accordingly he retired after a few weeks’ service,but was made a member of the Senate, of which he became president.After finishing his political career, he published other works ofgreat moment; but of those I shall not speak. About the year 1827 hewas seized with an acute disorder, which soon terminated his life. Hislast words are remarkable, as conveying the same truth that every wiseman has upon his lips at the hour of death. As he reviewed the amountof his learning, which was in one respect greater than that of any manliving, he exclaimed, “What we know here is very little, but what we areignorant of is immense.” Every man is compelled to become silent andmodest as he sees death approach. La Place was like other common men. Hedied as a man, and was buried, and the men of science felt sad that oneso learned and of so strong an intellect should have departed. Endowedby the Almighty with the loftiest powers of intellect, he stood alone,and commanded the respect, if he did not always gain the love, of hisassociates. Dr. Bowditch, though he regarded La Place as the greatestmathematician that had ever lived, had little real sympathy with hischaracter.[Sidenote: LAWS OF GRAVITY.][Sidenote: HALLEY’S COMET.][Sidenote: GRANDEUR OF MAN.][Sidenote: MOON’S MOTIONS.]We must now try to give you a short account of the “Mécanique Céleste,”and of Dr. Bowditch’s labors upon it. The original work consists offive volumes, but Dr. Bowditch lived to finish the translation of andcommentary upon only the first four. There are about fifteen hundredpages in the original, while there are three thousand eight hundred andeighteen in the American translation. The object of the original workmay be known from the following introductory remarks by La Place, onthe occasion of printing the first volume, in 1798: “Newton, towardsthe end of the last century, published his discovery of the laws ofgravity, or of the power by which the solar system is held together.Since that period, geometricians have succeeded in bringing under thislaw all the known phenomena of the system of the universe. I mean tobring together those scattered themes and facts upon this subject, so asto form one whole, which shall embrace all the known results of gravityupon the motions, forms, &c., of the fluid and solid bodies that composeour solar system, as well as of those other similar systems that arespread around in the immensity of space.” You probably all understandfrom this quotation the general object of the “Mécanique Céleste.” LaPlace likewise informs us that the work is divided into two parts. In thefirst he proposes to give the methods for determining the motions of theheavenly bodies, their forms, the motions of the oceans and seas upontheir surfaces, and finally the movements of rotation of these spheresabout their own axes. In the second part, he promises to apply the ruleswhich he has given in the first to the planets and the satellites whichmove around them, and likewise to the comets. The first part is found inthe first two volumes, the second part occupies the last two. From thesefew remarks you will perceive the immense task imposed upon himselfby La Place, and at the same time the grandeur of it. How wonderful,that a simple man can attempt to mark out the course of the heavenlybodies, which we see clustering around us at night! But how much morewonderful does man become, when we find he has the _power_ to foretellto us the return of comets that have never been seen by any one livingnow—comets that have been, during our lives, travelling into the far-offfields of space! Strange that a simple man can prophesy, to a day, theirreturn! Many of us now living remember a beautifully bright and clearcomet, which in 1835 appeared, as had been predicted, after an absenceof seventy-six years. It was called Halley’s comet, after its firstdiscoverer. At first it seemed like a bright speck in the heavens towardsthe north; but the next night it was larger. It seemed to approach, withfearful rapidity, from evening to evening, and, sweeping in majestyacross our western sky, disappeared gradually in its progress towards thesun, around which it whirled, and again appeared, more faintly visiblethan before, just over our eastern horizon, as if to give us one moreglimpse of itself, a strange messenger of the Almighty, before it passedoff on its far-distant journey, not to return until those who were thenyoung and free as air, are all laid quietly in the grave, or have becomeenfeebled and decrepit by the approach of age. Truly, great is God, whomade the comet; but to me man also seems full of grandeur, when I findhim capable of even _foretelling_ the exact passage of such a body.Yet La Place enables any man to prophesy this; and in his “MécaniqueCéleste” we may find all the methods of investigation necessary for thisobject. But he likewise tells us the forms of the planets; he enablesus to measure the ring which surrounds the planet Saturn, and enablesus to decide, at least in some degree the form and mass of the sun. Inthis same work he treats of those curious phenomena, which, as we seethem daily, we think of little moment—the flow and ebb of the sea, or,in other words, high and low tides,—and the causes of them. He treatsof the motion of the earth about its centre, and of the same motions inthe moon and planets. These are the chief objects of the first and secondvolumes. The third volume, as we have already hinted, contains questionsof great intricacy, and of immense importance; namely, the exact motionsof the planets around the sun, as affected by all the attractions exertedupon them by the various bodies of the universe; and the still moreimportant motions of our moon around the earth. I say important, becausethe exact knowledge of the course of this body is of the greatest momentto every sailor who attempts to go from one country to another over thetrackless ocean. By means of observations upon this planet, the seamancan sail over distant waters for many months, and be able to return,when he may wish, to his own home in safety. Hence the importance ofthe astronomer to the simple navigator of our planet. The history ofDr. Bowditch is another proof of the truth of this statement. By hisaccurate knowledge of astronomy, by his ability to follow La Place inhis investigations of all the motions of the solar system, he was enabledto produce a work on navigation which is sought for wherever the Englishlanguage is spoken, as it combines the best methods of using the resultsof pure astronomy in the art of navigation. The “Practical Navigator”would never have maintained its hold upon the community as it has done,if Dr. Bowditch had not been as skilful in mathematics and astronomy asin the details of navigation.[Sidenote: JUPITER’S SATELLITES.][Sidenote: PLANET NEPTUNE.]But to return to the “Mécanique Céleste.” The fourth volume containssimilar investigations, namely, the motions of the satellites, or moons,about the other planets. Our moon’s motions about the earth, and therevolutions of Jupiter’s satellites are the most important. Jupiter hasfour satellites. These were the first that the invention of the telescopeby Galileo revealed to man; and by their frequent revolutions aroundthe planet, they have in their turn shown to us many of the laws whichgovern the whole planetary system, besides many curious and interestingfacts in regard to their own forms and masses. From the eclipses ordisappearances of the first satellite, when it passes on the side of theplanet opposite to that at which the observer from the earth is looking,it has demonstrated the velocity of light. Finally, the author treats ofthe seven moons, or satellites, of Saturn, and likewise of those of theplanet Herschel, about which much less is known.[12][Sidenote: POWERS ACTING UPON COMETS.]After attending to these subjects, La Place investigates the powerswhich act upon comets, which tend to turn from their courses thosebodies, which, as I have before said, are flying in very many directionsthroughout the universe, and which are liable to be moved out of theirdirection by the actions of some planets near which they may come. Thiswas the case with a comet in 1770, whose course was wholly changed bythe planet Jupiter drawing it towards its own body. To investigate thevarious laws of these disturbing forces is one subject of this volume.Some other subjects are treated of, but of these I shall now not speak.[Sidenote: NOTES ON MÉCANIQUE CÉLESTE.]From this brief account of the “Mécanique Céleste” you may judge of thedifficulties which the original writer had to overcome in making it, andof the immense labor requisite. But La Place frequently supposes thata proposition is perfectly intelligible to his reader because it is soto him. Having such a powerful mind, he is able to see at a glance thatfor which any one else would require a long demonstration, before hecould become thoroughly master of the subject. The consequence of thisis, an obscurity in the work, which has made it doubly difficult ofcomprehension. Several years ago, but a long time after Dr. Bowditchhad read and made notes upon the whole work, an English writer said thatthere were scarcely twelve men in Europe capable of comprehending it.Dr. Bowditch, feeling that it was the most valuable work upon astronomypublished in modern times, had undertaken the translation of it, andhad made notes thereupon, for the purpose of “amusing his leisurehours.” Upon its being known that he had finished the task, the AmericanAcademy offered to publish it. Dr. Bowditch would not allow this, andreserved the publication until he was able to do so at his own expense.Let us see, now, what service Dr. Bowditch intended to perform by histranslation and commentary. His first object was to lay before Americathe greatest work on the science of astronomy ever published. Secondly,his aim was to bring that work down to the comprehension of young men,and students of mathematics, by filling up the places left by La Placewithout demonstration. Thirdly, he meant to give the history of thescience of astronomy for the interval between the publication of theoriginal work and that at which the translation appeared. Fourthly, hewished to collect together all the discoveries which he had made duringthe forty years of his life that he had devoted to science. His firstaim was gained by the translation. His second was completely successful,for he was assured by correspondents, both in America and Europe, thathe had enabled several to read the immortal work of La Place, who neverwould have done so had not Dr. Bowditch published his Commentary. Theroyal astronomer at Palermo says, in a printed work published afterthe first two volumes of the translation had reached him, “Bowditch’sCommentary should be translated into Italian;” and Lacroix, a celebratedFrench mathematician, advised a young Swiss to read La Place in theAmerican edition rather than in the original. But what pleased thecommentator more than anything else, were the frequent letters from youngmen residing in various parts of America, expressing gratitude for thebenefits they had received from his work. When I think of these, I amreminded of the epithet bestowed upon Dr. Bowditch since his death, andby one well capable of judging, namely, “Father of American Mathematics.”He has given a tone to the study of science which will be long felt.In regard to the third object, all critics allow that he was eminentlysuccessful in giving the history of science up to the time proposed.Upon the fourth point, we might refer, first, to the immense increase ofbulk of the work, as a proof, but I prefer to mention a few details; andin order to this, let us examine the Commentary, and let it speak foritself. But it must be remembered, that, in making this examination, Imust omit many circumstances, because you would not understand or feelinterested in any greater detail.[Sidenote: ERRORS IN IT.][Sidenote: PERMANENCE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.][Sidenote: ERROR IN PRINCIPIA.]In the first volume he points out two errors of La Place, one of whichrelates to the motion of the earth; and the other is of much importance.It relates to the permanency of our solar system, as it is commonlycalled. You all doubtless know that the sun is situated in the centre,and the planets, with our earth, revolve around this luminary, whichgives light and heat to all. Now, these bodies revolve in certain fixed“nearly circular” directions, and La Place thought that they would alwayscontinue to do so, and that Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter,Saturn, and Herschel would forever continue to wheel around in theiraccustomed orbits. Dr. Bowditch proves, however, that though this maybe true of the three larger planets,—Jupiter, Saturn, and Herschel,—itis not equally certain, _from the proofs given by La Place_, that ourearth, or any of the other smaller planets, may not fly off into regionsfar remote from those in which they have been revolving for ages. Thiserror had been made the subject of a paper to the American Academy at anearlier period of his life. But it must not be supposed that there isany proof that the solar system will not continue to exist for many longages. On the contrary, there is no doubt that it will last millions ofyears. Dr. Bowditch merely wished to assert that La Place’s argument andcalculation did not prove as much as the French mathematician thoughtthey did. In this volume Dr. Bowditch likewise alludes to a topic whichhe had made the subject of a communication, a long time previously, tothe American Academy; I refer to a mistake in Newton’s “Principia,”which he discovered when quite young, and had sent an account of to thepresident of Harvard College. This gentleman referred the question to theprofessor of mathematics, who believed the youth was mistaken. Doubtlesshe thought it very strange that a simple youth should presume to correctanything published by so eminent a man as Newton. The error of theprofessor will become less singular when you learn that the same mistakeescaped the notice of all the commentators on the “Principia,”—thatis, for more than a century,—and that the cause of the originalcommunication being made to the Academy was the attempt of Mr. Emerson,an Englishman, to prove the correctness of the English philosopher. Everyone, I believe, now allows that Dr. Bowditch was correct, and that aconsiderable error would result, in calculating the orbit of a comet,from using Newton’s calculations.CHAPTER XI.    Commentary continued; second volume.—Discussion between    the English and French mathematicians; Dr. Bowditch’s    criticisms.—Errors in La Place in regard to the earth,    &c.—Third volume; motions of the moon.—Fourth volume; many    errors discovered in it.—Halley’s Comet.—Curious phenomena of    capillary attraction.[Sidenote: CRITIC OF IVORY AND POISSON.][Sidenote: “I HAVE GOT IT!”]In the second volume of the Commentary, Dr. Bowditch makes very copiousnotes, in which he shows a perfect knowledge of the works of the chiefmathematicians of Europe. He stands as critic between two of the eminentmen of science of that day—Messrs. Ivory and Poisson, the former anEnglishman, the latter a Frenchman; and in reference, likewise, to adifficult subject, namely, the revolution or the turning of a fluid massupon its own axis, as our earth does. He not merely agrees with Mr.Poisson, but, by a very simple illustration, proves the total inaccuracyof Mr. Ivory’s views. I well remember the earnestness with which hestudied this subject. Day after day, he returned to the task of findingout some “simple case,” with which to prove to the satisfaction of othersthe truth of his own view. At length, when he did discover it, he jumpedup in ecstasy, and, rubbing his hands and forehead with delight, walkedabout the library-room, crying out, “I have got it!”Dr. Bowditch in this volume points out five errors or omissions made byLa Place, some of which are very important. One refers to the form ofour earth, and had been previously communicated to the Academy. There isanother of some moment, relative to the time occupied in the revolutionof one of Saturn’s rings, La Place having made it longer than was true.Finally, on the subject of the motion of the earth about its centre ofgravity, he points out an error, in which La Place gives to two numbersonly one third of their true value.[Sidenote: OLBERS AND GAUSS.]In the third volume, occupied as it is with the motions of the planetsand of the moon, and with all the phenomena accompanying these, Dr.Bowditch shows much learning, and his power of bringing modern scienceto the thorough study of any topic. As in the previous volume, he laborswithout fear upon subjects treated of with much earnestness by La Place,Poisson, and Pontecoulant, in France, and Plana in Italy.On the theory of the motions of the moon,—a very difficult andinteresting subject,—Dr. Bowditch makes very copious notes; and thevolume terminates with an appendix of more than two hundred and fiftypages, in which he gives the history of modern astronomy, in referenceto the calculations of the movements of planets and comets. In this hespeaks of Olbers and Gauss. The former, from having discovered threeplanets since the beginning of this century, was called “The fortunateColumbus of the Heavens.” The latter was one of the most remarkable menin the world for the rapidity with which he was able to perform the mosttedious and troublesome calculations.[13][Sidenote: ERRORS IN LA PLACE.]We come now to the last volume, in printing the thousandth page of whichhe died. It was the most difficult to him of the whole, and probablywill raise him higher, in the estimation of the scientific world, thaneither of the others. In the first place, I would remark, that eitherfrom the difficulty of the subject, or from the inattention of La Place,an unusual number of errors was discovered. No less than twenty-fourerrors or omissions are pointed out. Many of these seem insignificant,but often, as may be supposed, they materially affect the calculation.Most of them refer to the derangements and the motions of Jupiter’ssatellites—a subject which occupies three hundred and fourteen pages ofthe volume. The keenness of Dr. Bowditch’s criticism is again perceivedwhile treating upon a subject in dispute between Plana and La Place. Dr.Bowditch points out one mistake, and Poisson another, whereby Plana’sviews are proved to coincide entirely with La Place’s, instead of beingopposed to them.[Sidenote: NOTE ON HALLEY’S COMET.]I find a note upon Halley’s comet, to which I alluded as presentinga grand spectacle in our western sky a few years since, and I cannotforbear mentioning the coincidence. Dr. Bowditch, when making his notesupon the subject of the motions and revolutions of comets, speaks ofHalley’s comet, and mentions all that is known about it, and its probableappearance. This note was prepared some time before it was printed. Itterminates thus: “Since writing the preceding part of this note the comethas again appeared, and, _at the time of printing this page, is visiblein the heavens_, not far distant from the place corresponding to theelements of Mr. Pontecoulant.”[Sidenote: CAPILLARY ATTRACTION.][Sidenote: LA PLACE AND POISSON.]The work, so far as Dr. Bowditch is concerned, finishes with the mostcurious and difficult subject of capillary attraction, or that powerwhereby a liquid rises in narrow tubes beyond the level of the fluidoutside, as we see familiarly in sponges, and cloths, and in very minuteglass tubes. You may think this subject of little moment; yet La Placethought it more curious than almost any other, and he earnestly callsthe attention of mathematicians to it. It is a subject so difficultof investigation, that it requires the keenest efforts of the bestintellects to rightly understand it. After La Place’s investigationswere published, Gauss considered the subject, and arrived at resultssimilar to those presented by La Place. But in 1831, Poisson, the firstmathematician then living, of whom we have already spoken, put fortha work in which he announced many new views. This he thought himselfjustified in doing, after taking into consideration certain particularswhich La Place had neglected. Dr. Bowditch received the work whileengaged in printing this volume. He ceased printing, and devoted sixmonths or more to a thorough perusal of the new French work. The resultwas, that he proved that without an exception, unless where an evidenterror was made by La Place, the principles of this mathematician, whenfairly carried out, would produce all the results which Poisson had givenas new in his work. By this labor Dr. Bowditch proved that Poisson’sso-called new theory of capillary attraction was founded in error. Thisis decidedly the most important work of the translator. It places himmuch higher than before in the scale of mathematical rank.I would willingly give a further analysis, but I forbear, because itwould not be interesting to you. It was in correcting this, his noblesttask, in the full strength of his intellect, that he was destined to die.CHAPTER XII.    Sketch of the life of La Grange, the equal of La Place; love    Dr. Bowditch had for this person’s character; comparison    between him and La Place; also between him and Dr.    Bowditch.—Conclusion of the Memoir[Sidenote: BOWDITCH AND LA GRANGE.]During this history I frequently have spoken of different individuals;but there is one about whom little mention has been made, but of whoselife I wish to give you a short account, as his character resembles verymuch that of Dr. Bowditch. His mind and heart were always regarded by theAmerican mathematician with feelings of respect and love, such as he felttowards no other mathematician whose works he had studied. An equal of LaPlace, it seems not improper to mention him; and I know you will excusethe slight interruption in my story when you perceive how the noblenature of La Grange seems to harmonize with, and to illustrate, as itwere, the life of Dr. Bowditch.[Sidenote: LIFE OF LA GRANGE.][Sidenote: HIS INTELLECT AND MODESTY.][Sidenote: LA GRANGE AND LA PLACE.][Sidenote: LA GRANGE AND BOWDITCH.][Sidenote: DEATH OF LA GRANGE.]Joseph Louis La Grange, one of the most famous geometricians of moderntimes, was born at Turin, January 25, 1736. He was one of elevenchildren of parents who became very poor, so that Joseph had in earlylife to gain his own subsistence. When young, he devoted himself tothe classics, and read Latin constantly. At seventeen his taste forabstruse mathematics and geometry first showed itself; and from thisperiod he continued studying by himself, without aid. In two years hehad acquired a knowledge of all that was known upon the science, andbegan to correspond with the scientific men of other lands. In 1755he sent to Euler, then the greatest mathematician in the world, andresiding in Berlin, an answer to a problem proposed by Euler, ten yearsbefore, to the learned men of Europe, and which they had been unableto solve. He was appointed professor of mathematics at Turin, at theage of nineteen years, and soon afterwards originated the Academy ofSciences at that place. In their Memoirs he published papers in whichhe not merely criticised Euler and D’Alembert and others, but broughtforward some very curious new views of science, discovered by himself.Europe soon resounded with his praises, and he was chosen member of allthe learned societies. In 1766, he was called to the court of Frederickthe Great, King of Prussia, to take the place of Euler, who was summonedby the Emperor of Russia to St. Petersburg. Frederick wrote to him thus:“Come to my court, for it is right that the greatest mathematician inEurope should be near the greatest king.” He accepted the situation thusoffered, and remained there until Frederick died; and soon afterwardshe was invited by the French government to go to Paris. From this time,with slight interruptions, his fame continued to increase, and everyone delighted to honor him; for his labors did honor to his adoptedcountry. One of the most beautiful compliments, perhaps, ever paid toman, was the message sent by the French government to the old father ofLa Grange at Piedmont, when that country fell, by a revolution, underFrench influence. “Go,” said the Minister of Foreign Affairs to hisambassador, “go to the venerable father of the illustrious La Grange,and say to him, that, after the events that have just taken place, theFrench government look to him as the first object of their interest.”The answer of the old man was touching: “This day is the happiest of mylife, and my son is the cause of it!” And thrice blessed must be such ason, for he fills the last hours of his father’s life with peace. WhenBonaparte came into power, new honors were showered upon him. But whatwas it that charmed Dr. Bowditch in the character of La Grange? It wasthe combination of a giant intellect with extreme modesty and simplicity,a sincere love of truth, and almost feminine affections. He was a purebeing, whose intellect equalled La Place’s, but who at the same time wasfull of the utmost gentleness and strict justice. He was at Berlin duringthe earlier part of La Place’s career in Paris. In after-life, the twowere friends. Both were great geniuses; both were capable of the highestflights of thought, and of bringing down to the comprehension of mankindthe vast and wise laws impressed by God on the system of the universe.La Place became interested in political life. La Grange stood aside,quiet and pleased with his own high thoughts. If his fellows wished himto take upon himself any public duties, he took them cheerfully, andas cheerfully resigned them. La Place courted honors; La Grange meeklyreceived them. La Place sometimes assumed the fruits of other men’slabors to cover himself with their glory. In the heart of La Grange sathumility, justice, and philanthropic love. In fact, La Grange was fullof the loftiest qualities and genius combined. La Place had the latter.His genius alone recommended him to the scientific men around him. Suchwere two men whose works Dr. Bowditch read with the greatest pleasure. Heoften spoke with great feeling of the noble traits in the character ofLa Grange. The features and form of the head of Dr. Bowditch resembledthose of the great Italian. I have often thought that, as they were likeeach other in countenance, so their dispositions and fortunes in lifewere more nearly similar than is usual in this world. Both were bornpoor, and early had to seek subsistence for themselves. Each devotedhimself early to the science of mathematics, and both became eminent init. Love of truth and a longing for it were strong traits in both; orderand regularity of life, and simplicity of food and regimen, belongedto them equally. Above all, a sincere reverence for goodness, for truemodesty and delicate refinement, and a fine respect for the female sex,were strikingly manifest in both. Both were moderate in their desires,and both had the highest good of humanity at heart. Each sought for quietand retirement from the turmoil of life in his “peaceful mathematics.”As the lives of both were beautiful, so was the serenity of their deathscenes. La Grange was attacked near the end of March, 1813, by a severefever, and the symptoms soon became alarming. He saw the danger he wasin, but still preserved his serenity. “I am studying,” says he, “whatis passing within me, as if I were now engaged in some great and rareexperiment.” On the 8th of April, his friends Messrs. Lacépède, Monge,and Chaptal visited him, and in a long conversation which he enteredinto with them, he showed that his memory was still unclouded, and hisintellect as bright as ever. He spoke to them of his actual condition,of his labors, of his success, of the tenor of his life, and expressedno regret at dying, except at the idea of being separated from his wife,whose kind attentions had been unremittingly bestowed upon him. He soonsank and died. Three days afterwards his body was deposited in thePantheon, as it is called, the burial-place for the great men of France;and La Place and his friend Lacépède delivered their tributes of praiseand admiration over his grave. So peaceful and calm was the death of Dr.Bowditch, whose life I have been trying to place before you.[Sidenote: MRS. BOWDITCH.]Dr. Bowditch’s health had been generally good, though he never wasrobust. In 1808 he was dangerously ill with a cough, and by the adviceof a physician, he took a journey in an open chaise. He was driventowards Pawtucket and Providence, thence in a westerly direction throughHartford and New Haven to Albany, and back again across the interior ofMassachusetts, as far as the fertile valley of the Connecticut River.Thence passing upwards, he crossed on the southern borders of Vermont andNew Hampshire to Newburyport, and back to Salem. This journey restoredhim, and he never afterwards suffered much from cough, and generallyenjoyed good health until his last illness.In 1834 his wife died. His heart was borne down by the loss. She hadbeen to him always a loving and a tender companion, faithful and trueeven to the minutest points. She had watched all his labors. She hadurged him onward in the pursuit of science, by telling him that shewould find the means of meeting any expense by her own economy in hercare of the family. She had watched the progress of his greatest work,which, with his dying hands, he afterwards dedicated to her memory. Shehad listened with delight to all the praises that had come to him fromhis own countrymen and from foreign lands; and now, when he was fullof honor and yet active in business, she was called to leave him. Withher the real charm of life departed, and many sad hours would have beenthe consequence, if his sense of duty and devotion to science had notprevented them. He attended now more closely to active engagements. Healways spoke of his wife with extreme fondness, and sometimes his tearswould flow in spite, apparently, of his efforts to restrain them. Therewas a degree of sadness, however, which was perceptible only to hisfamily, that settled upon Dr. Bowditch during the last four years oflife, in consequence of this deprivation.[Sidenote: LAST ILLNESS.][Sidenote: FAREWELL TO FRIENDS.][Sidenote: LOVE FOR HIS CHILDREN.]In the latter part of the summer and early days of autumn of 1837,he began to feel that he was losing strength, and had occasionallypains of great severity. He continued to attend to the duties of hisoffice, however, without yielding to his suffering. In January, 1838,he submitted to medical advice; but it was of no avail. He sank rapidlyunder a severe and torturing disease, which, for the last fortnight oflife, deprived him of the power of eating or even of drinking anything,except a small quantity of wine and water. Until the last moment of hislife, he was engaged in attending to the duties of the Life Office, andto the publication of his Commentary on the “Mécanique Céleste.” Duringthis time, after he lost the power of visiting State Street, he used towalk into his library, and there sit down among his beloved books, andpass the hours in gentle conversation with his friends, of each one ofwhom he seemed anxious to take a last farewell. He received them daily,in succession, during the forenoon; and towards those whom he lovedparticularly he showed his tenderness by kissing them when they met andwhen they parted. His conversation with them was of the most pleasantkind. He told them of his prospects of death, of his past life, and ofhis perfect calmness and reliance on God. He spoke to them of his loveof moral worth. “Talents without goodness I care little for,” said he toone of them. With his children he was always inexpressibly affectionate.“Come, my dears,” said he, “I fear you will think me very foolish, but Icannot help telling you all how much I love you; for whenever any of youapproach me, I feel as if I had a fountain of love, which gushes out uponyou.” He spoke to them at the dead of the night, when he awoke, pleasantas a little child, yet with the bright, clear mind of a philosopher. Hetold them of his life, of his desire always to be innocent, to be activein every duty, and in the acquirement of knowledge, and then alluded to amotto that he had impressed upon his mind in early life, that a good manmust have a happy death. On one of these occasions he said, “I feel nowquiet and happy, and I think my life has been somewhat blameless.”[Sidenote: WORDS OF COMFORT.]It was noon, and all was quiet in his library. A bright ray of lightstreamed through the half-closed shutter. He was calm and free frompain. One of his children bade him good by for a time. Stretching outhis hand and pointing to the sunlight, he said, “Good by, my son; thework is done; and if I knew I were to be gone when the sun sets in thewest, I would say, ‘Thy will, O God, be done.’” Observing some around himweeping, while he was quiet, he quoted his favorite passage from Hafiz,one of the sweetest of the poets of Persia:—    “So live, that, sinking in thy last long sleep,    Calm thou mayst smile while all around thee weep.”On another occasion, when one who was near him had a sad countenance, hetold her to be cheerful; and then, taking Bryant’s Poems he read the fourlast verses of that exquisite little poem called “The Old Man’s Funeral.”It is so beautiful in itself, that I want you to read it; and perhaps youmay like to see how he thought it applied to his own condition. I haveplaced in parentheses his remarks.[Sidenote: THE OLD MAN’S FUNERAL.]    THE OLD MAN’S FUNERAL.    I saw an aged man upon his bier;      His hair was thin and white, and on his brow    A record of the cares of many a year—      Cares that were ended and forgotten now.    And there was sadness round, and faces bowed,    And women’s tears fell fast, and children wailed aloud.    Then rose another hoary man, and said,      In faltering accents, to that weeping train,    “Why mourn ye that our aged friend is dead?      Ye are not sad to see the gathered grain,    Nor when their mellow fruit the orchards cast,    Nor when the yellow woods shake down the ripened mast.    “Ye sigh not when the sun, his course fulfilled,      His glorious course, rejoicing earth and sky,    In the soft evening, when the winds are stilled,      Sinks where his islands of refreshment lie,    And leaves the smile of his departure spread    O’er the warm-colored heaven and ruddy mountain head.    “Why weep ye then for him, who, having won      The bound of man’s appointed years, at last,    Life’s blessings all enjoyed, life’s labors done,      Serenely to his final rest has passed? [I cannot agree to the next             two lines.]    While the soft memory of his virtues yet    Lingers like twilight hues when the bright sun is set.    “His youth was innocent, [yes, I believe mine was innocent;             not guilty, certainly,] his riper age      Marked with some act of goodness every day, [no, not every             day—sometimes,]    And watched by eyes that loved him, calm and sage, [O, yes, watched             by eyes that loved him; and O, how calm, but I cannot add             sage,]      Faded his late declining years away.    Cheerful he gave his being up, and went    To share [he hopes] the holy rest that waits a life [he hopes] well             spent.    “That life was happy; every day he gave      Thanks for the fair existence that was his; [yes, every morning,             when I awoke and saw the beautiful sun rise, I thanked God             that he had placed me in this beautiful world,]    For a sick fancy made him not her slave,      To mock him with her phantom miseries.    No chronic tortures racked his aged limb,    For luxury and sloth had nourished none for him. [Yes, that is all             true.]    “And I am glad that he has lived thus long,      And glad that he has gone to his reward;    Nor deem that kindly nature did him wrong,      Softly to disengage the vital cord, [O, how softly, how sweetly, is             the cord disengaging!]    When his weak hand grew palsied, and his eye    Dark with the mists of age, it was his time to die.” [Yes, it was his             time to die; remember this; do not look sad or mournful; it             is his time to die.][Sidenote: LOVE OF FLOWERS AND MUSIC.]One of the pleasant effects of his illness was his new love for flowers.He had never shown any great pleasure in them during life, althougha rose, or lily of the valley, was frequently in his vest during thesummer. One day during his illness, Miss —— sent him a nosegay, in thecentre of which was a white camellia japonica. “Ah! how beautiful!” heexclaimed; “tell her how much I am pleased; place them where I can seethem. Tell her that the japonica is to me the emblem of her spotlessheart.” Music, too, as it had been his delight in early life, now servedto soothe his last hours. One evening, when surrounded by his family, andhe was free from all pain, the door of the library was suddenly opened,and his favorite tune of Robin Adair was heard coming from some musicalglasses in the entry. Its plaintiveness was always delightful to him: andafter listening to it till it died away, he exclaimed, “O, how beautiful!I feel as if I should like to have the tune that I have loved in lifeprove my funeral dirge.”[Sidenote: HIS DEATH.]It was on the 15th of March, 1838, that, being too feeble to walk, he wasdrawn for the last time into the library. On the next day he was confinedto the bed. On that day an incident took place which I cannot forbear tomention. He had called his daughter his Jessamine, and about twenty-fourhours before his death she obtained for him that delicate white flower.He took it and kissed it many times. He then returned it with thesewords: “Take it, my love; it is beautiful; it is the queen of flowers.Let it be for you, forever, the emblem of truth and of purity. Let it bethe Bowditch arms. Place it in your mother’s Bible, and by the side of LaPlace’s bust, and to-morrow, if I am alive, I will see it.”In the evening he drew a little water into his parched mouth. “Howdelicious!” he murmured. “I have swallowed a drop from            ‘Siloa’s brook, that flowed    Fast by the oracle of God.’”On the morrow, 17th of March, 1838, he died. Had he lived nine daysmore, he would have exactly completed his sixty-fifth year. On the nextSabbath he was laid quietly by the side of his wife Mary. Snow-flakesfell gently upon the coffin as it was carried into Trinity Church vaults.There both the bodies remained until a few years since, when they wereremoved to Mount Auburn.FOOTNOTES[1] You will know better, by and by, about the Revolutionary War. I willmerely state now, that this war was between America and Great Britain,in order to free ourselves from the power of England. The reason why theBritish King had anything to do with America was this: Many years ago, anumber of people came over from England, and settled in this country; andof course the small colony needed the aid of the government from which itoriginated. After a time the people here wanted to govern themselves, andthey therefore went to battle about it, because England would not grantthem all their wishes. This contest, which lasted for several years, wasterminated by the United States becoming free from the power of GreatBritain.[2] It is now in existence, and was kept in his library during hislifetime, and for many years afterwards. His library, at the time ofhis death, consisted of several thousand books, which, during his longlife, he had collected. Yet, to my mind, the little Almanac is the mostvaluable book of the whole, because it was the first evidence he gave ofhis perseverance, and of the tendencies of his mind. It is now, with hisother manuscripts, preserved in the Public Library of the City of Boston.The manuscripts and his whole library were given to the city when theopening of Devonshire Street, in continuation of Winthrop and Otis Place,required the removal of the house where they had been preserved from thetime of Mr. Bowditch’s death.[3] This was the famous battle of the Nile. It won for Nelson the titleof “Baron of the Nile.”[4] From Rev. Dr. Bentley’s manuscript Journal.[5] Dr. Bentley’s Journal, above cited.[6] This and similar acts committed by Great Britain were the prominentcauses of the war between the United States and England in 1812.[7] An expression of which sailors make use when speaking of the captainof the vessel, and on this occasion overheard by Mr. Bowditch, as twosailors whispered one to another, as they passed him on the deck.[8] It is still (1869) used in the American, and often in the Englishmarine service. The twenty-eighth edition was only recently published;about seventy-five thousand copies have been issued since the firstedition was printed under the special direction of Mr. Bowditch.[9] Chief Justice Parsons, it is said, used to say that moment was oneof the most exciting of his life; and he could not forbear throwing uphis hat and joining in the shout with which the boys saluted the firstreturning light of the sun.[10] Since the first edition of this memoir, the whole subject ofmeteoric stones has been more thoroughly investigated by astronomers.Professor Loomis, of New Haven, says (Elements of Astronomy, 1869,page 209), “In the year 1833, shooting stars appeared in extraordinarynumbers, on the morning of November 14. It was estimated that they fellat the rate of five hundred and seventy-five per minute. Most of thesemeteors moved in paths, which, if traced backward, would meet in a pointnear Gamma, in the constellation Leo. A similar exhibition took placeon the 12th of November, 1799, and there are recorded ten other similarappearances at about the same period of the year.“There was a repetition of this remarkable display of meteors on themorning of November 14, 1866, when the number amounted to one hundredand twenty-six per minute; also November 14, 1867, when the number ofmeteors for a short time amounted to two hundred and twenty per minute;and November 14, 1868, the display was about equally remarkable.”Professor Loomis concludes that “these meteors belong to a systemof bodies describing an elliptic orbit about the sun, and making arevolution in thirty-three years.”The Weston meteor, or aerolite, observed by Dr. Bowditch, is mentionedby Professor Loomis, as one of “great brilliancy.” “The entire weight ofthe fragments discovered was at least three hundred pounds.... The lengthof the visible path of this meteor exceeded one hundred miles. It movedabout fifteen miles per second.”[11] A fifth was printed several years afterwards, on which Mr. Bowditchmade some notes, and which he meant to have published, but deathprevented him from so doing.[12] Since the first edition of this memoir, one of the mostextraordinary results ever obtained in astronomy by the use of these samemethods of investigation has been made known. Messrs. Leverrier, a Frenchastronomer, and Adams of England, calculated very exactly the generalcharacteristics and course of a planet, which, from the disturbances ofthe courses of other well-known planets, was _supposed_ to exist. In1846, Leverrier requested a German astronomer to point his telescope, ata certain time, towards a certain part of the heavens, and there was thelong-suspected planet, previously never seen! It was named Neptune. It issixty times larger than our earth, and its orbit is nearly thirty timesfarther distant from the sun.[13] Within the last few years numerous other smaller bodies (asteroids)have been discovered—not less than eighty being now known.End of Project Gutenberg's Nat the Navigator, by Henry Ingersoll Bowditch*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NAT THE NAVIGATOR ******** This file should be named 61092-0.txt or 61092-0.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/1/0/9/61092/Produced by The Online Distributed Proofreading Team athttp://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from imagesgenerously made available by The Internet Archive)Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tmProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety ofcomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. Itexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donationsfrom people in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm'sgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection willremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and futuregenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SENDDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particularstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donateWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donationmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. Todonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donateSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the ProjectGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could befreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced anddistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network ofvolunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paperedition.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG searchfacility: www.gutenberg.orgThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
